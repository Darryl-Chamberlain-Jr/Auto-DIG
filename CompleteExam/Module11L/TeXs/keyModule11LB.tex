List 10 numbers you should use to estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 7 from the right.
\[ \frac{\frac{7}{x} - 1}{x - 7} \]The solution is \( \{ 7.1000, 7.0100, 7.0010, 7.0001 \} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
This is correct!
If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 7 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
These values would estimate the limit of 7 on the left.
If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 7 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 6} \frac{\sqrt{4x - 8} - 4}{7x - 42} \]The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \).\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\textbf{Plausible alternative answers include:}You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.071.
