You modeled the situation correctly but did not apply the properties of log correctly.

The solution is \( \text{Linear model} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Linear model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a mostly straight line of points.
\item \( \text{Logarithmic model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want a rapid change early, then an extremely slow change later.
\item \( \text{Exponential model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want an extremely slow change early, then a rapid change later.
\item \( \text{Non-linear Power model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a polynomial or rational shape.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want to see no pattern in the points.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This question is testing if you can associate the models with their graphical representation. If you are having trouble, go back to the corresponding Core module to learn about the specific function you are having trouble recognizing.

For the information below, construct a linear model that describes the total time $T$ spent on the path in terms of the distance of a particular part of the path \textit{if we know that all parts of the path are equal length}.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ A bicyclist is training for a race on a hilly path. Their bike keeps track of their speed at any time, but not the distance traveled. Their speed traveling up a hill is 6 mph, 11 mph when traveling down a hill, and 8 mph when traveling along a flat portion. }

The solution is \( 0.383 D \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 25.000 D \)

The coefficient here is calculated as if you were trying to model the distance on the total path.
\item \( 528.000 D \)

The coefficient here is calculated by multiplying the distances together rather than adding.
\item \( 0.383 D \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{The model can be found with the information provided, but isn't options 1-3.} \)

Since we know all parts of the path are equal length, we can treat all distance variables as the same variable, $D$.
\item \( \text{The model cannot be found with the information provided.} \)

If you chose this option, please contact the coordinator to discuss why you think we cannot model the situation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure you pay attention to the variable we are writing the model in terms of. To create the model with a single variable, we have to know that variable is the same throughout each path!

    \textit{ In CHM2045L, Brittany created a 15 liter 14 percent solution of chemical $\chi$ using two different solution percentages of chemical $\chi$.

\item \( 4.41 liters \)

This is the concentration of 26 percent solution.
\item \( 4.66 liters \)

This was a random value. If this was not a guess, contact the coordinator to talk about how you got this value.

This would be correct if Brittany used equal parts of each solution.
\item \( 10.59 liters \)

*This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{There is not enough information to solve the problem.} \)

You may have chose this if you thought you needed to know how much of the second solution was used in the problem. Remember that the total minus the first solution would give you the second amount used.

For the scenario below, find the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible).

    \textit{ In an alternative galaxy, the square of the time, $T$ (Earth years), required for a planet to orbit Sun $\chi$ increases as the cube of the distance, $d$ (AUs), that the planet is from Sun $\chi$ increases.

The solution is \( k = 42.632 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = 666125.000 \)

This corresponds to the model $T^{2} = \frac{k}{d^{3}}$.
\item \( k = 42.632 \)

* This is the correct option corresponding to the model $T^{2} = k d^{3}$.
\item \( k = 4.997 \)

This corresponds to the model $T^{1/2} = k d^{1/3}$.
\item \( k = 4.028 \)

This copies the constant used in the homework.

This corresponds to believing you cannot determine the type of model from the information given.

\textbf{General Comment:} Since $T$ increases proportionally as $d$ increases, we know this is a direct variation model.
