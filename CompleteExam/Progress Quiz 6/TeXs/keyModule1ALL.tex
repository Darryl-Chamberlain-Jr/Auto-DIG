Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{13225}{25}} \]The solution is \( \text{Whole} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

* This is the correct option!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $115$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
