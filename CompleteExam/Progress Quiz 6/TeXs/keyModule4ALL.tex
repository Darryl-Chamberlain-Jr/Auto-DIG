Write the equation of the graph presented below in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, assuming  $a=1$ or $a=-1$. Then, choose the intervals that $a, b,$ and $c$ belong to.

The solution is \( f(x) = -x^{2} +8 x -12 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-1.6, -0.7], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [5, 11], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [-15, -11] \)

* $f(x)=-x^{2} +8 x -12$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-1.6, -0.7], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-8, -7], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [-15, -11] \)

$f(x)=-x^{2} -8 x -12$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$.
\item \( a \in [0.3, 2], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [5, 11], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [18, 21] \)

$f(x)=x^{2} +8 x + 20$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$ AND making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
\item \( a \in [-1.6, -0.7], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-8, -7], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [-22, -19] \)

$f(x)=-x^{2} -8 x -20$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2 - k$.
\item \( a \in [0.3, 2], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-8, -7], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [18, 21] \)

$f(x)=x^{2} -8 x + 20$, which corresponds to making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
