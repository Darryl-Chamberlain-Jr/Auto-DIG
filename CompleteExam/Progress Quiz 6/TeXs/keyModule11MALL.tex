The solution is \( \text{Linear model} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Logarithmic model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want a rapid change early, then an extremely slow change later.
\item \( \text{Linear model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a mostly straight line of points.
\item \( \text{Exponential model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want an extremely slow change early, then a rapid change later.
\item \( \text{Non-linear Power model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a polynomial or rational shape.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want to see no pattern in the points.

A town has an initial population of 20000. The town's population for the next 10 years is provided below. Which type of function would be most appropriate to model the town's population?

\item \( \text{Logarithmic} \)

This suggests the slowest of growths that we know.
\item \( \text{Exponential} \)

This suggests the fastest of growths that we know.
\item \( \text{Non-Linear Power} \)

This suggests a growth faster than constant but slower than exponential.
\item \( \text{Linear} \)

This suggests a constant growth. You would be able to add or subtract the same amount year-to-year if this is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

Please contact the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the options model the population.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

Using the scenario below, model the situation using an exponential function and a base of $\frac{1}{2}$. Then, solve for the half-life of the element, rounding to the nearest day.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ The half-life of an element is the amount of time it takes for the element to decay to half of its initial starting amount. There is initially 861 grams of element $X$ and after 6 years there is 123 grams remaining. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 730 \text{ days} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 730 \text{ days} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 2555 \text{ days} \)

This uses the correct model but solves for the exponential constant incorrectly.
\item \( \text{About } 1095 \text{ days} \)

This uses the correct model but a base of $e$ rather than $\frac{1}{2}$.
\item \( \text{About } 1 \text{ day} \)

This models half-life as a linear function.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

Please contact the coordinator if you believe all the options above are incorrect.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The model should be $A(t) = A_0 (\frac{1}{2})^{kt}$, where $A(t)$ is the amount after $t$ years, $A_0$ is the initial amount, and $k$ is decay constant. To find the half-life, you need to solve for $k$ by using the amount after $x$ years, then solve for the time $t$ when $A = \frac{A_0}{2}$. Your answer would be in years, so convert to days.

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?
