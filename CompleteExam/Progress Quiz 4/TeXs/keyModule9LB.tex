Determine whether the function below is 1-1.
\[ f(x) = -24 x^2 + 4 x + 580 \]The solution is \( \text{no} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{No, because there is a $y$-value that goes to 2 different $x$-values.} \)

* This is the solution.
\item \( \text{No, because there is an $x$-value that goes to 2 different $y$-values.} \)

Corresponds to the Vertical Line test, which checks if an expression is a function.
\item \( \text{Yes, the function is 1-1.} \)

Corresponds to believing the function passes the Horizontal Line test.
\item \( \text{No, because the range of the function is not $(-\infty, \infty)$.} \)

Corresponds to believing 1-1 means the range is all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{No, because the domain of the function is not $(-\infty, \infty)$.} \)

Corresponds to believing 1-1 means the domain is all Real numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} There are only two valid options: The function is 1-1 OR No because there is a $y$-value that goes to 2 different $x$-values.

Find the inverse of the function below. Then, evaluate the inverse at $x = 7$ and choose the interval that $f^-1(7)$ belongs to.
\[ f(x) = e^{x-4}-2 \]The solution is \( f^{-1}(7) = 6.197 \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f^{-1}(7) \in [-1.91, -1.76] \)
