Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -8 + 5 x \leq \frac{20 x - 4}{3} < 7 + 3 x \]The solution is \( \text{None of the above.} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [0.75, 9] \text{ and } b \in [-3.75, -1.5] \)

$(4.00, -2.27]$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints.
\item \( [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [-2.25, 6.75] \text{ and } b \in [-5.25, -0.75] \)

$[4.00, -2.27)$, which is the correct interval but negatives of the actual endpoints.
\item \( (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0.75, 6] \text{ and } b \in [-5.25, -0.75] \)

$(-\infty, 4.00] \cup (-2.27, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints.
\item \( (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [3, 4.5] \text{ and } b \in [-8.25, -0.75] \)

$(-\infty, 4.00) \cup [-2.27, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality AND getting negatives of the actual endpoints.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

* This is correct as the answer should be $[-4.00, 2.27)$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.

Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ \frac{8}{7} - \frac{10}{9} x \geq \frac{-8}{5} x - \frac{10}{3} \]The solution is \( [-9.156, \infty) \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [7.5, 9.75] \)

\item \( (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-12, -4.5] \)

\item \( \text{None of the above}. \)

You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals.

Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.

\item \( (-\infty, -6) \cup (0, \infty) \)

This describes the values more than 3 from -3
\item \( (-\infty, -6] \cup [0, \infty) \)
