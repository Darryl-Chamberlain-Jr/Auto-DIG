For the scenario below, model the rate of vibration (cm/s) of the string in terms of the length of the string. Then determine the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible). The constant should be in terms of cm and s.

    \textit{ The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string.

    \textit{ In economics, there are two common equations to model interest earned. The compound interest formula is $A = P (1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$, where $A$ is the amount of money you end up with, $P$ is your starting money, $r$ is the interest rate, $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year, and $t$ is the total number of years. For example, if you were a parent and wanted to save \$10,000 in 3 years-time at 3.5\% interest compounded monthly, you would need to invest about \$9,000. }
