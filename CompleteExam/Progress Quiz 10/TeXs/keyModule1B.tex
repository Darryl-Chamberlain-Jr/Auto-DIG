\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textbf{If you have a suggestion to make the keys better, \href{https://forms.gle/CZkbZmPbC9XALEE88}{please fill out the short survey here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{-2380}{0}}+\sqrt{63} \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 1 - 2 \div 9 * 20 - (5 * 15) \]The solution is \( -78.444 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-75.01, -72.01] \)

 -74.011, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [-126.67, -123.67] \)

 -126.667, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( [71.99, 82.99] \)

 75.989, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [-83.44, -77.44] \)

* -78.444, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (5 - 2 i)(8 + 10 i) \]The solution is \( 60 + 34 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [59, 63] \text{ and } b \in [-40, -32] \)

 $60 - 34 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [59, 63] \text{ and } b \in [31, 37] \)

* $60 + 34 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [15, 22] \text{ and } b \in [65, 71] \)

 $20 + 66 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [39, 44] \text{ and } b \in [-21, -19] \)

 $40 - 20 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [15, 22] \text{ and } b \in [-70, -57] \)

 $20 - 66 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 6 - 18^2 + 17 \div 11 * 5 \div 10 \]The solution is \( -317.227 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-318.23, -317.26] \)

 -317.969, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [329.64, 330.72] \)

 330.031, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [330.23, 331.02] \)

 330.773, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
\item \( [-317.26, -317.09] \)

* -317.227, this is the correct option

\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

* This is the correct option!

\item \( a \in [1.9, 3.1] \text{ and } b \in [9, 11] \)

 $2.59  + 9.49 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [9.6, 9.85] \text{ and } b \in [-51.5, -50] \)

 $9.80  - 51.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [9.6, 9.85] \text{ and } b \in [-2.5, 0] \)

* $9.80  - 0.84 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [597.5, 598.55] \text{ and } b \in [-2.5, 0] \)

 $598.00  - 0.84 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\item \( a \in [10.25, 10.9] \text{ and } b \in [8, 9] \)

 $10.50  + 8.80 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.

\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-3 - 10 i)(8 + 5 i) \]The solution is \( 26 - 95 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [23, 31] \text{ and } b \in [87, 103] \)

 $26 + 95 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.

 $-24 - 50 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-74, -70] \text{ and } b \in [64, 66] \)

 $-74 + 65 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.

Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

* This is the correct option!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-90$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
