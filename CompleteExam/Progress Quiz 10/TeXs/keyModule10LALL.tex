 Distractor 3: Corresponds to negatives of all zeros AND inversing rational roots.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to try the middle-most integers first as these normally are the zeros. Also, once you get it to a quadratic, you can use your other factoring techniques to finish factoring.

What are the \textit{possible Integer} roots of the polynomial below?
\[ f(x) = 6x^{3} +6 x^{2} +6 x + 5 \]The solution is \( \pm 1,\pm 5 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \pm 1,\pm 5 \)

* This is the solution \textbf{since we asked for the possible Integer roots}!
\item \( \text{ All combinations of: }\frac{\pm 1,\pm 5}{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6} \)

This would have been the solution \textbf{if asked for the possible Rational roots}!
\item \( \text{ All combinations of: }\frac{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6}{\pm 1,\pm 5} \)

 Distractor 3: Corresponds to the plus or minus of the inverse quotient (an/a0) of the factors. 
\item \( \pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6 \)

 Distractor 1: Corresponds to the plus or minus factors of a1 only.
\item \( \text{There is no formula or theorem that tells us all possible Integer roots.} \)

 Distractor 4: Corresponds to not recognizing Integers as a subset of Rationals.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a way to find the possible Rational roots. The possible Integer roots are the Integers in this list.

Perform the division below. Then, find the intervals that correspond to the quotient in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ and remainder $r$.
\[ \frac{25x^{3} +80 x^{2} +9 x -15}{x + 3} \]The solution is \( 25x^{2} +5 x -6 + \frac{3}{x + 3} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [23, 28], \text{   } b \in [-20, -14], \text{   } c \in [89, 90], \text{   and   } r \in [-372, -364]. \)

 You multiplied by the synthetic number and subtracted rather than adding during synthetic division.
\item \( a \in [23, 28], \text{   } b \in [1, 11], \text{   } c \in [-6, 3], \text{   and   } r \in [3, 6]. \)

* This is the solution!
\item \( a \in [-76, -72], \text{   } b \in [304, 309], \text{   } c \in [-908, -902], \text{   and   } r \in [2702, 2704]. \)

 You multiplied by the synthetic number rather than bringing the first factor down.
\item \( a \in [-76, -72], \text{   } b \in [-149, -135], \text{   } c \in [-429, -423], \text{   and   } r \in [-1293, -1287]. \)

 You divided by the opposite of the factor AND multiplied the first factor rather than just bringing it down.
\item \( a \in [23, 28], \text{   } b \in [154, 156], \text{   } c \in [465, 479], \text{   and   } r \in [1401, 1410]. \)

 You divided by the opposite of the factor.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to synthetically divide by the zero of the denominator!
