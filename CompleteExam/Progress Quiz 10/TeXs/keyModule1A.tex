\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{169}{0}}+\sqrt{60} i \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 8 - 1 \div 20 * 5 - (4 * 13) \]The solution is \( -44.250 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [59.76, 60.65] \)

 59.990, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [48.71, 49.16] \)

 48.750, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( [-44.2, -43.15] \)

 -44.010, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [-44.61, -44.11] \)

* -44.250, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-6 - 2 i)(8 - 9 i) \]The solution is \( -66 + 38 i \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-70, -63] \text{ and } b \in [38, 47] \)

* $-66 + 38 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-51, -47] \text{ and } b \in [17, 20] \)

 $-48 + 18 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-33, -26] \text{ and } b \in [-77, -66] \)

 $-30 - 70 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [-70, -63] \text{ and } b \in [-43, -36] \)

 $-66 - 38 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-33, -26] \text{ and } b \in [68, 77] \)

 $-30 + 70 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 15 - 11^2 + 3 \div 10 * 7 \div 12 \]The solution is \( -105.825 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [135.9, 136.06] \)

 136.004, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [-105.89, -105.76] \)

* -105.825, this is the correct option
\item \( [-106.13, -105.98] \)

 -105.996, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [136.12, 136.33] \)

 136.175, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.

\[ \sqrt{\frac{0}{484}}+\sqrt{10}i \]The solution is \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).

\[ \frac{63 + 33 i}{8 - 5 i} \]The solution is \( 3.81  + 6.51 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [7.45, 7.55] \text{ and } b \in [-1, 0] \)

 $7.52  - 0.57 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [3.7, 4.4] \text{ and } b \in [5.5, 7.5] \)

* $3.81  + 6.51 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [3.7, 4.4] \text{ and } b \in [578.5, 580.5] \)

 $3.81  + 579.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [7.85, 7.95] \text{ and } b \in [-7, -6] \)

 $7.88  - 6.60 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [338.9, 339.05] \text{ and } b \in [5.5, 7.5] \)

 $339.00  + 6.51 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (2 - 5 i)(-9 + 3 i) \]The solution is \( -3 + 51 i \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-5, 4] \text{ and } b \in [-56, -44] \)

 $-3 - 51 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-22, -15] \text{ and } b \in [-17, -13] \)

 $-18 - 15 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-35, -31] \text{ and } b \in [38, 47] \)

 $-33 + 39 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.

Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.

\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

* This is the correct option!

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)

\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-\sqrt{\frac{15}{0}}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
