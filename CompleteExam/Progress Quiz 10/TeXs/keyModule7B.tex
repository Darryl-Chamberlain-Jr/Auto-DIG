Choose the equation of the function graphed below.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../Figures/rationalGraphToEquationCopyB.png}
\end{center}


The solution is \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x + 2} + 3 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x + 2} + 3 \)

This is the correct option.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{(x - 2)^2} + 3 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$, and the opposite leading coefficient.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x + 2)^2} + 3 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 2} + 3 \)

Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$ and the opposite leading coefficient.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

This corresponds to believing the vertex of the graph was not correct.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.
}
\litem{
Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{-84}{84x + 36} + 1 = \frac{-84}{84x + 36} \]The solution is \( \text{all solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [-1.43,0.57] \)

$x = -0.429$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
\item \( x \in [0,1.3] \)

$x = 0.429$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $84x + 36$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.7, 0.2] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.4,1.7] \)

$x = -0.429 \text{ and } x = 0.429$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.7, 0.2] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.9,-0.2] \)

$x = -0.429 \text{ and } x = -0.429$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

*$x = -0.429$ leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution, which is the correct option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

\litem{
Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{6}{25x^{2} +45 x + 18} \]The solution is \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = -1.200 \text{ and } x = -0.600. \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-2.1, -0.7] \text{ and } b \in [-0.9, -0.2] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -1.200$ and $x = -0.600$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-30.6, -29.5] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -30.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-30.6, -29.5] \text{ and } b \in [-15.9, -14.6] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -30.000$ and $x = -15.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-2.1, -0.7] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -1.200$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.
