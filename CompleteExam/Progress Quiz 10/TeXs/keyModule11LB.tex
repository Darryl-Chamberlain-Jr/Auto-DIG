\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Evaluate the one-sided limit of the function $f(x)$ below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 1^-} \frac{7}{(x+1)^8}+9 \]The solution is \( f(1) \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \infty \)


\item \( -\infty \)


\item \( f(1) \)


\item \( \text{The limit does not exist} \)


\item \( \text{None of the above} \)


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} You should be able to graph the rational function displayed. If not, go back to Module 7 to learn about the general shape of rational functions.

\litem{
Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{\sqrt{9x - 38} - 5}{2x - 14} \]The solution is \( 0.450 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 0.450 \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( 0.100 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( 0.050 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you got a limit that does not match any of the above, please contact the coordinator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 7$.

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ $f(x)$ approaches $5.689$ as $x$ approaches $\infty$. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 5.689 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)

\item \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \)

\textbf{General Comment:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $\infty$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(\infty)$!

For the graph below, find the value(s) $a$ that makes the statement true: $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = 3$.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 9 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{9}{x} - 1}{x - 9} \]The solution is \( \{ 9.1000, 9.0100, 9.0010, 9.0001 \} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 8.9000, 8.9900, 8.9990, 8.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 9 on the left.
\item \( \{ 8.9000, 8.9900, 9.0100, 9.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 9.0000, 9.1000, 9.0100, 9.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 9 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 9.0000, 8.9000, 8.9900, 8.9990 \} \)

This is correct!

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 7} \frac{\sqrt{5x - 10} - 5}{4x - 28} \]The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 0.559 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.

\item \( 0.100 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 3 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{3}{x} - 1}{x - 3} \]The solution is \( \{ 2.9000, 2.9900, 2.9990, 2.9999 \} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
