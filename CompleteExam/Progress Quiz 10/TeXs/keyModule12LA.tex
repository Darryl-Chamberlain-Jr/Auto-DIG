\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = 1.5 \text{ and } x = 0.75 \text{ with a hole at } x = -1.25 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 2.0 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.25 \)

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.5 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.25 \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Holes at } x = 1.5 \text{ and } x = -1.25 \text{ with no vertical asymptotes.} \)
