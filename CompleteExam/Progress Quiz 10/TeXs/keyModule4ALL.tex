\item \( a \in [6.46, 9.19], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-10, 3], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [1.12, 3.12], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [4, 8] \)

 $(8x -3)(2x + 5)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of a to c.
\item \( a \in [0.69, 1.04], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-18, -11], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [0.84, 1.66], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [15, 22] \)

 $(x -12)(x + 20)$, which corresponds to factoring $x^{2} +8 x -240$.
\item \( a \in [1.68, 2.6], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-10, 3], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [7.22, 8.16], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [4, 8] \)

 $(2x -3)(8x + 5)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of c to a.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

 Corresponds to a different factoring than any of the predicted options. If you get this, please let the coordinator know so they can work with you to figure out what went wrong with your factoring.

\textbf{General Comment:} $ac$ had many factors in this problem. It is best to list out the possible pairs in order to make sure you don't miss any.
