 Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains $x$ (if it exists).
\[  14 = \sqrt[3]{\frac{9}{e^{7x}}} \]The solution is \( x = -0.817 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [-0.91, -0.62] \)

* $x = -0.817$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x \in [-7.34, -6.26] \)

$x = -6.314$, which corresponds to thinking you don't need to take the natural log of both sides before reducing, as if the equation already had a natural log on the right side.
\item \( x \in [-0.47, 0.88] \)

$x = -0.440$, which corresponds to treating any root as a square root.
\item \( \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} \)

This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

This corresponds to making an unexpected error.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(9)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.

Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -\log_2{(x+4)}-9 \]The solution is \( (\infty, \infty) \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
