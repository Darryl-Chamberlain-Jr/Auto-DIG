\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a radical equation is $ f(x) = a \sqrt[b]{x - h} + k $, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either 1 or -1), $b$ is the root degree (in this case, either 2 or 3), and $(h, k)$ is the vertex.

Solve the radical equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{14 x^2 + 10} - \sqrt{39 x} = 0 \]The solution is \( \text{that there are two solutions and they are } x = 0.286 \text{ and } x = 2.500. \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [-0.2,1.2] \)

$x = 0.286$, which corresponds to thinking that $x = 2.500$ leads to a negative in at least one of the radicands.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

Corresponds to thinking that $x = 0.286 \text{ and } x = 2.500$ lead to negatives in at least one of the radicands.
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.2, 1.2] \text{ and } x_2 \in [2.5,5.5] \)

* $x = 0.286 \text{ and } x = 2.500$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x_1 \in [-4.5, -0.9] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-5.29,0.71] \)

$x = -2.500 \text{ and } x = -0.286$, which are the negative or absolute values of the values you would have gotten by solving the equation correctly.
\item \( x \in [1.9,5.3] \)

$x = 2.500$, which corresponds to thinking that $x = 0.286$ leads to a negative in at least one of the radicands.

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. For example, if the question is designed to have 0 options, then the distractors are solving the equation and not checking that the solutions lead to complex numbers (because plugging them in makes the value under the square root negative). Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation take the square root of a negative number!

The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x - 12} - 5 \)

This would be the correct option if the root degree was $2$.
\item \( f(x) = - \sqrt[3]{x - 12} - 5 \)

This corresponds to switching the coefficient and having the correct vertex with the root degree as $3$.
\item \( f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x + 12} - 5 \)

This corresponds to the correct coefficient and switching the $x$-value of the vertex with the root degree as $3$.
\item \( f(x) = - \sqrt[3]{x + 12} - 5 \)

This corresponds to switching the coefficient AND switching the $x$-value of the vertex with the root degree as $3$.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is correct! The general shape of the graph is not correct for the radical power.

\item \( \text{The domain is } (-\infty, a], \text{   where } a \in [-2.33, 2.67] \)

$(-\infty, -0.333]$, which corresponds to if the radical had an even power AND reversing the direction of the domain.

* This is the correct option since the radical has an odd power.
\item \( \text{The domain is } [a, \infty), \text{   where } a \in [-5, -2] \)

$[-3.000, \infty)$, which corresponds to if the radical had an even power AND using the negative of the correct pivot value.
\item \( \text{The domain is } [a, \infty), \text{   where } a \in [-2.33, 3.67] \)

$[-0.333, \infty)$, which corresponds to if the radical had an even power.
