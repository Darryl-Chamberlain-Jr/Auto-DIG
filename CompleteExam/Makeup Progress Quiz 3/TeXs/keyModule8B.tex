\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Solve the equation for $x$ and choose the interval that contains the solution (if it exists).
\[ 3^{5x-2} = \left(\frac{1}{64}\right)^{2x+4} \]The solution is \( x = -1.045 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [0.7, 2.3] \)

$x = 2.000$, which corresponds to solving the numerators as equal while ignoring the bases are different.
\item \( x \in [-0.5, 1] \)

$x = 0.434$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the first term of the exponent only.
\item \( x \in [-5.8, -4] \)

$x = -4.813$, which corresponds to distributing the $\ln(base)$ to the second term of the exponent only.
\item \( x \in [-1.3, -0.9] \)

* $x = -1.045$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} \)

This corresponds to believing there is no solution since the bases are not powers of each other.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} This question was written so that the bases could not be written the same. You will need to take the log of both sides.

\litem{
Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -e^{x+7}-4 \]The solution is \( (-\infty, -4) \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

* $(-\infty, -4)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( [a, \infty), a \in [2, 5] \)

$[4, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND flipping the Range interval AND including the endpoint.
\item \( (a, \infty), a \in [2, 5] \)

\item \( (-\infty, a], a \in [-5, -3] \)

\item \( (-\infty, \infty) \)

This corresponds to confusing range of an exponential function with the domain of an exponential function.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: Domain of a basic exponential function is $(-\infty, \infty)$ while the Range is $(0, \infty)$. We can shift these intervals [and even flip when $a<0$!] to find the new Domain/Range.

$x = -1.707$, which corresponds to thinking you need to take the natural log of on the left before reducing.
\item \( \text{There is no Real solution to the equation.} \)

This corresponds to believing you cannot solve the equation.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

This corresponds to making an unexpected error.

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: After using the properties of logarithmic functions to break up the right-hand side, use $\ln(e) = 1$ to reduce the question to a linear function to solve. You can put $\ln(26)$ into a calculator if you are having trouble.
