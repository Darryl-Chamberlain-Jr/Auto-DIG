Determine whether the function below is 1-1.
\[ f(x) = 36 x^2 - 252 x + 441 \]The solution is \( \text{no} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{No, because the domain of the function is not $(-\infty, \infty)$.} \)

Corresponds to believing 1-1 means the domain is all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{No, because there is an $x$-value that goes to 2 different $y$-values.} \)

Corresponds to the Vertical Line test, which checks if an expression is a function.
\item \( \text{No, because there is a $y$-value that goes to 2 different $x$-values.} \)

* This is the solution.
\item \( \text{Yes, the function is 1-1.} \)

Corresponds to believing the function passes the Horizontal Line test.
\item \( \text{No, because the range of the function is not $(-\infty, \infty)$.} \)

Corresponds to believing 1-1 means the range is all Real numbers.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} There are only two valid options: The function is 1-1 OR No because there is a $y$-value that goes to 2 different $x$-values.

 Distractor 4: This corresponds to both distractors 2 and 3.

 Distractor 3: This corresponds to finding the (nonexistent) inverse and dividing by a negative.
