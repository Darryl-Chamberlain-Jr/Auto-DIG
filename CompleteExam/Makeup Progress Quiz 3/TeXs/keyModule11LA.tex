Evaluate the one-sided limit of the function $f(x)$ below, if possible.

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( 0.100 \)

* This is the correct option.

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ $f(x)$ approaches $17.923$ as $x$ approaches $7$. }

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 4 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{4}{x} - 1}{x - 4} \]The solution is \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990, 3.9999 \} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 4.0100, 4.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990, 3.9999 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010, 4.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 4 on the right.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
