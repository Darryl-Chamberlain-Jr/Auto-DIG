Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
\[ \text{ Less than } 9 \text{ units from the number } 7. \]The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (2, 16) \)

This describes the values less than 7 from 9
\item \( (-\infty, 2] \cup [16, \infty) \)

This describes the values no less than 7 from 9
\item \( (-\infty, 2) \cup (16, \infty) \)

Options A-D described the values [more/less than] 7 units from 9, which is the reverse of what the question asked.
