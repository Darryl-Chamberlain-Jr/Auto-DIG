\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{52900}{100}} \]The solution is \( \text{Integer} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-230$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 13 - 3^2 + 2 \div 11 * 12 \div 19 \]The solution is \( 4.115 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [4.09, 4.14] \)

* 4.115, this is the correct option
\item \( [21.99, 22.07] \)

 22.001, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [22.11, 22.5] \)

 22.115, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
\item \( [3.74, 4.09] \)

 4.001, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-5 - 3 i)(6 + 9 i) \]The solution is \( -3 - 63 i \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-7, 0] \text{ and } b \in [-66, -61] \)

* $-3 - 63 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-62, -56] \text{ and } b \in [24, 33] \)

 $-57 + 27 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [-62, -56] \text{ and } b \in [-27, -22] \)

 $-57 - 27 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [-34, -25] \text{ and } b \in [-27, -22] \)

 $-30 - 27 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-7, 0] \text{ and } b \in [58, 68] \)

 $-3 + 63 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-5 - 8 i)(-3 + 7 i) \]The solution is \( 71 - 11 i \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-43, -35] \text{ and } b \in [-59, -58] \)

 $-41 - 59 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [-43, -35] \text{ and } b \in [56, 61] \)

 $-41 + 59 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [13, 17] \text{ and } b \in [-57, -49] \)

 $15 - 56 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [69, 72] \text{ and } b \in [7, 12] \)

 $71 + 11 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [69, 72] \text{ and } b \in [-12, -7] \)

* $71 - 11 i$, which is the correct option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.

\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \frac{9}{-7}+25i^2 \]The solution is \( \text{Rational} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.

\item \( [-143, -138] \)

* -143.000, which is the correct option.

\item \( a \in [4, 7.5] \text{ and } b \in [5, 6] \)

* $6.41  + 5.57 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [236.5, 237.5] \text{ and } b \in [5, 6] \)

 $237.00  + 5.57 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
