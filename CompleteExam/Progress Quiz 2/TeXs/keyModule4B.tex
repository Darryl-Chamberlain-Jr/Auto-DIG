Solve the quadratic equation below. Then, choose the intervals that the solutions belong to, with $x_1 \leq x_2$ (if they exist).
\[ 19x^{2} +11 x -9 = 0 \]The solution is \( x_1 = -1.036 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.457 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.6, -0.08] \text{ and } x_2 \in [0.9, 1.11] \)

 $x_1 = -0.457 \text{ and } x_2 = 1.036$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $\frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.65, -0.82] \text{ and } x_2 \in [0.27, 0.99] \)

 $x_1 = -19.686 \text{ and } x_2 = 8.686$, which corresponds to using the Quadratic Formula with $a=1$
\item \( x_1 \in [-28.81, -27.69] \text{ and } x_2 \in [27.6, 28.12] \)

 $x_1 = -28.662 \text{ and } x_2 = 28.083$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
\item \( \text{There are no Real solutions.} \)

Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.

 $(8x + 3)(3x + 5)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of a to c.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

 Corresponds to a different factoring than any of the predicted options. If you get this, please let the coordinator know so they can work with you to figure out what went wrong with your factoring.
