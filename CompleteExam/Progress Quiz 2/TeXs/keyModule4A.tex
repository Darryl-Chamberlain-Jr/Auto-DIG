\item \( x_1 \in [-1.28, -1.09] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.5, 0.7] \)

* $x_1 = -1.138 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.320$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x_1 \in [-3.72, -3.35] \text{ and } x_2 \in [12, 14.5] \)

 $x_1 = -3.516 \text{ and } x_2 = 12.516$, which corresponds to using the Quadratic Formula with $a=1$

 $x_1 = -16.440 \text{ and } x_2 = 15.622$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
\item \( \text{There are no Real solutions.} \)

Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.
