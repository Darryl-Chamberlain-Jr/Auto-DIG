\item \( A \in [-0.1, 4.5], \hspace{3mm} B \in [4.6, 8], \text{ and } \hspace{3mm} C \in [-16, -12] \)

 $3x + 5y = -15$, which corresponds to using the opposite (negative) slope of the graph, but did everything else correctly.
\item \( A \in [-1.8, -0.5], \hspace{3mm} B \in [-1.9, 0.2], \text{ and } \hspace{3mm} C \in [3, 8] \)

\[ \text{Perpendicular to } 7 x - 8 y = 5 \text{ and passing through the point } (10, 9). \]The solution is \( y = -1.14x + 20.43 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( m \in [-1.6, -0.99] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [19.4, 20.9] \)

\item \( m \in [-1.6, -0.99] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [-1.3, 0.8] \)

 $y = -1.14x - 1.00$, which corresponds to correct slope and mis-distributing while simplifying to slope-intercept form.

 $y = 1.14x - 2.43$, which corresponds to using the negative slope.

\textbf{General Comment:} Parallel slope is the same and perpendicular slope is opposite reciprocal. Opposite reciprocal means flipping the fraction and changing the sign (positive to negative or negative to positive).
