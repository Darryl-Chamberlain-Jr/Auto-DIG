\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{-72 + 77 i}{5 + 3 i} \]The solution is \( -3.79  + 17.68 i \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-18, -16.5] \text{ and } b \in [3.5, 5.5] \)

 $-17.38  + 4.97 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [-15.5, -13] \text{ and } b \in [25, 26.5] \)

 $-14.40  + 25.67 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [-6, -2.5] \text{ and } b \in [600.5, 602.5] \)

 $-3.79  + 601.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [-6, -2.5] \text{ and } b \in [16, 19] \)

* $-3.79  + 17.68 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-130, -128] \text{ and } b \in [16, 19] \)

 $-129.00  + 17.68 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 2 - 14 \div 3 * 11 - (20 * 17) \]The solution is \( -389.333 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-391.33, -387.33] \)

* -389.333, which is the correct option.
\item \( [337.58, 343.58] \)

 341.576, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [-341.42, -336.42] \)

 -338.424, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [-1181.67, -1176.67] \)

 -1178.667, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.

\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{441}{7}} \]The solution is \( \text{Irrational} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-\sqrt{63}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{858}{6}}+2i^2 \]The solution is \( \text{Irrational} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.

 -285.993, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [291.99, 292.52] \)

 292.007, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [292.43, 293.37] \)

 293.219, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$

* -284.781, this is the correct option

\item \( a \in [-76.5, -75.5] \text{ and } b \in [-6.5, -4] \)

 $-76.00  - 4.97 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\item \( a \in [1, 3.5] \text{ and } b \in [-9.5, -8.5] \)

 $2.25  - 8.80 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.

 $-0.85  - 442.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.

 $-74 + 47 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [-18, -15] \text{ and } b \in [-57, -52] \)

 $-18 - 56 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
