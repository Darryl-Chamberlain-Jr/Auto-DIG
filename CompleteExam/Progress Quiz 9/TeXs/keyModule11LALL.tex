You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ As $x$ approaches $\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $9.515$. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 9.515 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) \text{ is undefined when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( x \text{ is undefined when } f(x) \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 9.515 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \)

\textbf{General Comment:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $\infty$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(\infty)$!

Evaluate the one-sided limit of the function $f(x)$ below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 2^-} \frac{-3}{(x-2)^6}+5 \]The solution is \( -\infty \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 5 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{5}{x} - 1}{x - 5} \]The solution is \( \{ 4.9000, 4.9900, 4.9990, 4.9999 \} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 5.1000, 5.0100, 5.0010, 5.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 5 on the right.
\item \( \{ 5.0000, 5.1000, 5.0100, 5.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 5 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 4.9000, 4.9900, 5.0100, 5.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 5.0000, 4.9000, 4.9900, 4.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 5 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 4.9000, 4.9900, 4.9990, 4.9999 \} \)

This is correct!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
