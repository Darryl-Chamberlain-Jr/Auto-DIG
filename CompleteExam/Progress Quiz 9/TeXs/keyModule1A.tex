\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 13 - 4^2 + 11 \div 17 * 15 \div 10 \]The solution is \( -2.029 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [29.43, 30.3] \)

 29.971, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
\item \( [-2.83, -1.86] \)

* -2.029, this is the correct option
\item \( [-3.87, -2.33] \)

 -2.996, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [28.66, 29.69] \)

 29.004, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{-2160}{9}} \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Real number} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-\sqrt{240} i$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{9 - 77 i}{8 - 6 i} \]The solution is \( 5.34  - 5.62 i \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [533, 535] \text{ and } b \in [-6.5, -4.5] \)

 $534.00  - 5.62 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\item \( a \in [-4.5, -2.5] \text{ and } b \in [-8, -6] \)

 $-3.90  - 6.70 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [4.5, 6.5] \text{ and } b \in [-6.5, -4.5] \)

* $5.34  - 5.62 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [1, 2.5] \text{ and } b \in [12, 14] \)

 $1.12  + 12.83 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [4.5, 6.5] \text{ and } b \in [-562.5, -561] \)

 $5.34  - 562.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (4 - 9 i)(-2 - 10 i) \]The solution is \( -98 - 22 i \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [79, 87] \text{ and } b \in [56, 62] \)

 $82 + 58 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [-16, -7] \text{ and } b \in [88, 93] \)

 $-8 + 90 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-99, -94] \text{ and } b \in [19, 23] \)

 $-98 + 22 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-99, -94] \text{ and } b \in [-24, -21] \)

* $-98 - 22 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [79, 87] \text{ and } b \in [-64, -57] \)

 $82 - 58 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{0}{15}}+\sqrt{4}i \]The solution is \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-8 + 5 i)(-9 - 7 i) \]The solution is \( 107 + 11 i \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [31, 44] \text{ and } b \in [98, 104] \)

 $37 + 101 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [65, 78] \text{ and } b \in [-37, -29] \)

 $72 - 35 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [107, 110] \text{ and } b \in [11, 15] \)

* $107 + 11 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [107, 110] \text{ and } b \in [-15, -7] \)

 $107 - 11 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.

 $37 - 101 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.

\item \( [84.7, 85.14] \)

 84.902, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [-79.27, -77.74] \)

 -79.158, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( [-75.97, -73.49] \)

 -75.098, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [-80.42, -79.52] \)

\item \( a \in [-428, -425.5] \text{ and } b \in [6, 8.5] \)

 $-426.00  + 7.92 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
