Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{-54}{-18x -36} + 1 = \frac{-54}{-18x -36} \]The solution is \( \text{all solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-2, -1] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-3,-1] \)

$x = -2.000 \text{ and } x = -2.000$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

*$x = -2.000$ leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution, which is the correct option.
\item \( x \in [0,3] \)

$x = 2.000$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-18x -36$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( x_1 \in [-2, -1] \text{ and } x_2 \in [1,4] \)

$x = -2.000 \text{ and } x = 2.000$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [-3.0,-1.0] \)

$x = -2.000$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

Choose the graph of the equation below.

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.

\[ \frac{7x}{2x -4} + \frac{-5x^{2}}{8x^{2} -20 x + 8} = \frac{4}{4x -2} \]The solution is \( \text{All solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

* The equation leads to solving $33x^{2} -22 x + 16=0$, which leads to complex solutions. This is the correct option.

$x = 2.000 \text{ and } x = 0.500$, which corresponds to solving $2x -4 = 0$ and $4x -2 = 0$ and treating them as solutions to the equation.
\item \( x \in [0.03,1.35] \)

$x = 0.500$, which corresponds to solving $4x -2 = 0$ and treating it as a solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [1.95,3.73] \)

$x = 2.000$, which corresponds to solving $2x -4 = 0$ and treating it as a solution to the equation.
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.93, -0.13] \text{ and } x_2 \in [0.71,1.15] \)

$x = -0.278 \text{ and } x = 0.945$, which corresponds to making the discriminant from the Quadratic Formula positive to avoid complex solutions.

Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{3}{18x^{2} +30 x + 12} \]The solution is \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = -1.000 \text{ and } x = -0.667. \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-1.93, -0.86] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -1.000$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.

All Real numbers except $x = -1.000$ and $x = -0.667$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-24.6, -23.08] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -24.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator.

All Real numbers except $x = -24.000$ and $x = -9.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.

$x = -0.963$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-6x + 9$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.

This corresponds to thinking $x = 2.037$ leads to dividing by zero in the original equation, which it does not.
