 $(3x -5)(18x -2)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of c to a.
\item \( a \in [-1, 2], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-47, -41], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [-1.5, 1.3], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [-12, -9] \)

 $(x -45)(x -12)$, which corresponds to factoring $x^{2} -57 x + 540$.
\item \( a \in [4, 8], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-8, -4], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [6.7, 12.2], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [-8, -1] \)

* $(6x -5)(9x -2)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

 Corresponds to a different factoring than any of the predicted options. If you get this, please let the coordinator know so they can work with you to figure out what went wrong with your factoring.

\textbf{General Comment:} $ac$ had many factors in this problem. It is best to list out the possible pairs in order to make sure you don't miss any.

Solve the quadratic equation below. Then, choose the intervals that the solutions belong to, with $x_1 \leq x_2$ (if they exist).
\[ 17x^{2} +9 x -3 = 0 \]The solution is \( x_1 = -0.761 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.232 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-17.47, -16.76] \text{ and } x_2 \in [16.34, 17.07] \)

 $x_1 = -17.147 \text{ and } x_2 = 16.617$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.3, 0.67] \text{ and } x_2 \in [0.59, 1.42] \)

 $x_1 = -0.232 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.761$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $\frac{b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$
\item \( x_1 \in [-13.31, -12.64] \text{ and } x_2 \in [3.72, 4.19] \)

 $x_1 = -12.941 \text{ and } x_2 = 3.941$, which corresponds to using the Quadratic Formula with $a=1$
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.82, -0.57] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.77, 0.32] \)

* $x_1 = -0.761 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.232$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{There are no Real solutions.} \)

Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This requires Quadratic Formula. Just be sure to use the correct formula and watch your signs.
