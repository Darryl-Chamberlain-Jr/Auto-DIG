For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 31 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 9 \text{ percent} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 9 \text{ percent} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 3 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
\item \( \text{About } 16 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 14 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.

The solution is \( \text{About } 43 \text{ days} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 43 \text{ days} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 14 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base and did not apply the properties of log correctly.

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base, but solved correctly otherwise.

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $190^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $15^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 28 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $130^{\circ}$ C. }

The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = -0.01793 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ correctly.
\item \( k = -0.02749 \)

This uses $A$ correctly and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.04570 \)

This uses $A$ as the bath temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.02713 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct answer as $k = -0.01499$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The initial temperature is when $t = 0$. Unlike power models, that means $A$ is not the initial temperature!

    \textit{ In CHM2045L, Brittany created a 29 liter 23 percent solution of chemical $\chi$ using two different solution percentages of chemical $\chi$. When she went to write her lab report, she realized she forgot to write the amount of each solution she used!

The solution is \( 4.83 liters \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 20.16 liters \)

This was a random value. If this was not a guess, contact the coordinator to talk about how you got this value.
\item \( 14.50 liters \)

This would be correct if Brittany used equal parts of each solution.
\item \( 4.83 liters \)

*This is the correct option.

Using the situation below, construct a linear model that describes the cost of the coffee beans $C(h)$ in terms of the weight of the high-quality coffee beans $h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Veronica needs to prepare 210 of blended coffee beans selling for \$5.34 per pound. She has a high-quality bean that sells for \$6.02 a pound and a low-quality bean that sells for \$4.47 a pound. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( C(h) = 1.55 h + 938.70 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( C(h) = 6.02 h \)

This models the cost of the high-quality bean only, not the blended beans.
\item \( C(h) = 1.55 h + 938.70 \)

* This is the correct option since the questions asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the high-quality bean.
\item \( C(h) = -1.55 h + 1264.20 \)

This would be correct if the question asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the low-quality bean.
\item \( C(h) = 5.24 h \)

This assumes that exactly half of the high- and low- quality beans are mixed to create the blended coffee beans.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

If you chose this option, please talk to the coordinator to discuss why.

For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 42 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 12 \text{ percent} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 21 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 12 \text{ percent} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 19 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
\item \( \text{About } 3 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.

This would be correct if Brittany used equal parts of each solution.

    \textit{ A newly discovered bacteria, $\alpha$, is being examined in a lab. The lab started with a petri dish of 3 bacteria-$\alpha$. After 1 hours, the petri dish has 105 bacteria-$\alpha$.

This uses the wrong base and solves for the constant correctly but converted incorrectly.

This uses the wrong base and does not solve for the constant correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 11 \text{ minutes} \)

This uses the wrong base.

\textbf{General Comment:} Your model should be $P(t) = P_0(b)^{kt}$, where $P(t)$ is the population at some time $t$, $P_0$ is the initial population, and $k$ is the replication rate. Be sure you convert the hours into minutes!
