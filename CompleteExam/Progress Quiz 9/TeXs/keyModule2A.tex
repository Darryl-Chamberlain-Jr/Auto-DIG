First, find the equation of the line containing the two points below. Then, write the equation in the form $ y=mx+b $ and choose the intervals that contain $m$ and $b$.
\[ (4, -10) \text{ and } (-10, 4) \]The solution is \( y = -x -6.0 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( m \in [-3.2, -0.3] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [4, 12] \)

 $y = -x + 6.0$, which corresponds to using the correct slope and getting the negative y-intercept.

 $y = -x -14$, which corresponds to using the correct slope/equation but not distributing correctly using the first point.
