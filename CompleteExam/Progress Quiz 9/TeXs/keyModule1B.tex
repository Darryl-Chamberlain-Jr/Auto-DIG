\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 4 - 20^2 + 2 \div 6 * 16 \div 7 \]The solution is \( -395.238 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-395.45, -394.63] \)

* -395.238, this is the correct option
\item \( [403.57, 404.34] \)

 404.003, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [-396.71, -395.71] \)

 -395.997, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [404.69, 404.85] \)

 404.762, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: multiplying by negative before squaring. For example: $(-3)^2 \neq -3^2$
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{576}{49}} \]The solution is \( \text{Rational} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-\frac{24}{7}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{54 + 44 i}{-1 + 5 i} \]The solution is \( 6.38  - 12.08 i \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-55.5, -53] \text{ and } b \in [8.74, 8.84] \)

 $-54.00  + 8.80 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [6, 7.5] \text{ and } b \in [-314.01, -313.96] \)

 $6.38  - 314.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [165, 167] \text{ and } b \in [-12.08, -12.05] \)

 $166.00  - 12.08 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\item \( a \in [6, 7.5] \text{ and } b \in [-12.08, -12.05] \)

* $6.38  - 12.08 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-11, -10] \text{ and } b \in [8.65, 8.71] \)

 $-10.54  + 8.69 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-10 + 2 i)(-4 + 3 i) \]The solution is \( 34 - 38 i \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [34, 36] \text{ and } b \in [-44, -34] \)

* $34 - 38 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [42, 50] \text{ and } b \in [-25, -21] \)

 $46 - 22 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [34, 36] \text{ and } b \in [34, 39] \)

 $34 + 38 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [38, 42] \text{ and } b \in [-9, 10] \)

 $40 + 6 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [42, 50] \text{ and } b \in [17, 27] \)

 $46 + 22 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{-1815}{11}}+\sqrt{0}i \]The solution is \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-2 + 8 i)(5 + 7 i) \]The solution is \( -66 + 26 i \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-68, -63] \text{ and } b \in [-26.15, -24.4] \)

 $-66 - 26 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [46, 49] \text{ and } b \in [53.91, 54.51] \)

 $46 + 54 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [-68, -63] \text{ and } b \in [25.99, 27.39] \)

* $-66 + 26 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-18, -5] \text{ and } b \in [55.28, 56.57] \)

 $-10 + 56 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [46, 49] \text{ and } b \in [-54.41, -53.76] \)

 $46 - 54 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.

\[ 18 - 12^2 + 7 \div 8 * 13 \div 16 \]The solution is \( -125.289 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-125.62, -124.54] \)

* -125.289, this is the correct option
\item \( [-126.26, -125.96] \)

 -125.996, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [161.86, 162.42] \)

 162.004, which corresponds to two Order of Operations errors.
\item \( [162.05, 162.91] \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
