\[ \frac{-30}{35x -10} + 1 = \frac{-30}{35x -10} \]The solution is \( \text{all solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [0.29,2.29] \)

$x = 0.286$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
