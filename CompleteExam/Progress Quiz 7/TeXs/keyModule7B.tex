Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{4}{20x^{2} +3 x -9} \]The solution is \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = -0.750 \text{ and } x = 0.600. \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-15, -8] \text{ and } b \in [14, 18] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -12.000$ and $x = 15.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [-3.75, 0.25] \text{ and } b \in [-0.4, 1.6] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -0.750$ and $x = 0.600$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-3.75, 0.25] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -0.750$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [-15, -8] \)

All Real numbers except $x = -12.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x-h}+k$, the opposite leading coefficient, AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x + 1)^2} + 2 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$ not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x + 1} + 2 \)

The $x$- and $y$-value of the equation does not match the graph.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 1} + 2 \)

Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x-h}+k$, the opposite leading coefficient AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.

None of the equation options were the correct equation.

Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{5}{5x + 7} + -5 = \frac{3}{10x + 14} \]The solution is \( x = -1.260 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.27, -1.2] \text{ and } x_2 \in [1.54,2.54] \)

$x = -1.260 \text{ and } x = 1.540$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.37, -1.31] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-2.26,-0.26] \)

$x = -1.320 \text{ and } x = -1.260$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

This corresponds to thinking $x = -1.260$ leads to dividing by zero in the original equation, which it does not.
\item \( x \in [-1.26,-0.26] \)

* $x = -1.260$, which is the correct option.

$x = 1.540$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $5x + 7$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.

$x = 0.333$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-117x -39$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
