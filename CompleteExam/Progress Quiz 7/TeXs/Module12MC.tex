The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant.

Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $130^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $16^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 40 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $63^{\circ}$ C. }
