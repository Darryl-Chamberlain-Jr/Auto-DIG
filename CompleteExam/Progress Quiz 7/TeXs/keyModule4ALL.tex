 $x_1 = -22.409 \text{ and } x_2 = 21.409$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
\item \( x_1 \in [-1.58, -0.97] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.3, 0.9] \)

* $x_1 = -1.413 \text{ and } x_2 = 0.413$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x_1 \in [-17.73, -16.66] \text{ and } x_2 \in [3.1, 6.8] \)

 $x_1 = -16.954 \text{ and } x_2 = 4.954$, which corresponds to using the Quadratic Formula with $a=1$
\item \( \text{There are no Real solutions.} \)

Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This requires Quadratic Formula. Just be sure to use the correct formula and watch your signs.

Factor the quadratic below. Then, choose the intervals that contain the constants in the form $(ax+b)(cx+d); b \leq d.$
\[ 36x^{2} -60 x + 25 \]The solution is \( (6x -5)(6x -5) \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-2.3, 2.1], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-31, -29], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [0.8, 1.8], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [-34, -25] \)

 $(x -30)(x -30)$, which corresponds to factoring $x^{2} -60 x + 900$.
\item \( a \in [2.9, 4], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-5, -2], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [11.6, 13.9], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [-6, -2] \)

 $(3x -5)(12x -5)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of c to a.
\item \( a \in [4.9, 6.6], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-5, -2], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [3.4, 6.6], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [-6, -2] \)

* $(6x -5)(6x -5)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [16.9, 18.3], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-5, -2], \hspace*{5mm} c \in [1.5, 3.2], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} d \in [-6, -2] \)

 $(18x -5)(2x -5)$, which corresponds to associating some factor of a to c.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

 Corresponds to a different factoring than any of the predicted options. If you get this, please let the coordinator know so they can work with you to figure out what went wrong with your factoring.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} $ac$ had many factors in this problem. It is best to list out the possible pairs in order to make sure you don't miss any.
