\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.

The solution is \( 0.00 liters \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 0.00 liters \)

*This is the correct option.

This is the concentration of 15 percent solution.

This would be correct if Brittany used equal parts of each solution.

Using the situation below, construct a linear model that describes the cost of the coffee beans $C(h)$ in terms of the weight of the high-quality coffee beans $h$.

    \textit{ Veronica needs to prepare 220 of blended coffee beans selling for \$3.06 per pound. She has a high-quality bean that sells for \$4.31 a pound and a low-quality bean that sells for \$2.47 a pound. }

This would be correct if the question asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the low-quality bean.
\item \( C(h) = 4.31 h \)

This models the cost of the high-quality bean only, not the blended beans.

This assumes that exactly half of the high- and low- quality beans are mixed to create the blended coffee beans.
\item \( C(h) = 1.84 h + 543.40 \)

If you chose this option, please talk to the coordinator to discuss why.

    \textit{ A bicyclist is training for a race on a hilly path. Their bike keeps track of their speed at any time, but not the distance traveled. Their speed traveling up a hill is 7 mph, 10 mph when traveling down a hill, and 8 mph when traveling along a flat portion. }

* This is the correct option.
\item \( 25.000 D \)

The coefficient here is calculated as if you were trying to model the distance on the total path.
\item \( 560.000 D \)

The coefficient here is calculated by multiplying the distances together rather than adding.
\item \( \text{The model can be found with the information provided, but isn't options 1-3.} \)

Since we know all parts of the path are equal length, we can treat all distance variables as the same variable, $D$.
\item \( \text{The model cannot be found with the information provided.} \)

If you chose this option, please contact the coordinator to discuss why you think we cannot model the situation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure you pay attention to the variable we are writing the model in terms of. To create the model with a single variable, we have to know that variable is the same throughout each path!

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $130^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $16^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 40 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $63^{\circ}$ C. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = -0.02551 \)

This uses $A$ as the bath temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.02543 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ correctly.
\item \( k = -0.01678 \)

This uses $A$ correctly and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.01640 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct answer as $k = -0.02215$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The initial temperature is when $t = 0$. Unlike power models, that means $A$ is not the initial temperature!

Using the situation below, construct a linear model that describes the cost of the coffee beans $C(h)$ in terms of the weight of the low-quality coffee beans $h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Veronica needs to prepare 130 of blended coffee beans selling for \$2.77 per pound. She has a high-quality bean that sells for \$3.28 a pound and a low-quality bean that sells for \$2.21 a pound. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( C(h) = -1.07 h + 426.40 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( C(h) = 2.21 h \)

This models the cost of the low-quality bean only, not the blended beans.
\item \( C(h) = -1.07 h + 426.40 \)

* This is the correct option since the questions asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the low-quality bean.
\item \( C(h) = 2.75 h \)

This assumes that exactly half of the high- and low- quality beans are mixed to create the blended coffee beans.
\item \( C(h) = 1.07 h + 287.30 \)

This would be correct if the question asked you to construct the cost model in terms of the weight of the high-quality bean.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

If you chose this option, please talk to the coordinator to discuss why.
