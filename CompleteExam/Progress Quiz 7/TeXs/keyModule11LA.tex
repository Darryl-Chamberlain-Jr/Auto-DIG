\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 4} \frac{\sqrt{6x - 8} - 4}{2x - 8} \]The solution is \( 0.375 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 1.225 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( 0.375 \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( 0.125 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you got a limit that does not match any of the above, please contact the coordinator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 4$.

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ As $x$ approaches $6$, $f(x)$ approaches $18.908$. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 18.908 \text{ when } x \text{ is close to } 6 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 18.908 \text{ when } x \text{ is close to } 6 \)


\item \( f(x) = 6 \text{ when } x \text{ is close to } 18.908 \)

\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 6 \text{ when } x \text{ is close to } 18.908 \)


\item \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \)


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $6$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(6)$!

For the graph below, find the value(s) $a$ that makes the statement true: $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = -\infty$.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 5 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{5}{x} - 1}{x - 5} \]The solution is \( \{ 4.9000, 4.9900, 4.9990, 4.9999 \} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 5.0000, 4.9000, 4.9900, 4.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 5 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 4.9000, 4.9900, 5.0100, 5.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 5.1000, 5.0100, 5.0010, 5.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 5 on the right.
\item \( \{ 4.9000, 4.9900, 4.9990, 4.9999 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 5.0000, 5.1000, 5.0100, 5.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 5 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

These values would estimate the limit of 10 on the left.
\item \( \{ 9.9000, 9.9900, 10.0100, 10.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.

\item \( 0.028 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
