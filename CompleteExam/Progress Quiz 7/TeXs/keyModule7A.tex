Determine the domain of the function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{5}{36x^{2} -66 x + 30} \]The solution is \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = 0.833 \text{ and } x = 1.000. \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [29.87, 30.11] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 30.000$, which corresponds to removing a distractor value from the denominator.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [0.66, 0.99] \text{ and } b \in [0.96, 1.04] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 0.833$ and $x = 1.000$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a \text{ and } x = b, \text{ where } a \in [29.87, 30.11] \text{ and } b \in [35.75, 36.14] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 30.000$ and $x = 36.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers except } x = a, \text{ where } a \in [0.66, 0.99] \)

All Real numbers except $x = 0.833$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Recall that dividing by zero is not a real number. Therefore the domain is all real numbers \textbf{except} those that make the denominator 0.

Choose the graph of the equation below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{-1}{x - 1} + 2 \]The solution is the graph below, which is option B.

The solution is \( \text{None of the above as it should be } f(x) = \frac{1}{(x - 3)^2} + 1 \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{(x + 3)^2} + 7 \)

The $x$- and $y$-value of the equation does not match the graph.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x - 3} + 7 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^2}+k$, the opposite leading coefficient, AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x - 3)^2} + 7 \)

Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^2}+k$, the opposite leading coefficient, AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 3} + 7 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x}$ AND not noticing the $y$-value was wrong.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

None of the equation options were the correct equation.

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.

The solution is \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x - 3} - 3 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{(x - 3)^2} - 3 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{(x + 3)^2} - 3 \)

Corresponds to thinking the graph was a shifted version of $\frac{1}{x^2}$, using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$, and the opposite leading coefficient.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{-1}{x - 3} - 3 \)

This is the correct option.
\item \( f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 3} - 3 \)

Corresponds to using the general form $f(x) = \frac{a}{x+h}+k$ and the opposite leading coefficient.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

This corresponds to believing the vertex of the graph was not correct.

Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{6}{-2x -3} + -5 = \frac{5}{-14x -21} \]The solution is \( x = -2.029 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [-1.03,1.97] \)

$x = 0.971$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-2x -3$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

This corresponds to thinking $x = -2.029$ leads to dividing by zero in the original equation, which it does not.
\item \( x_1 \in [-2.03, 0.97] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.03,1.97] \)

$x = -2.029 \text{ and } x = 0.971$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [-2.03,-0.03] \)

* $x = -2.029$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x_1 \in [-2.03, 0.97] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.6,0.4] \)

$x = -2.029 \text{ and } x = -1.600$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

$x = 0.062$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-8x + 2$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.

All Real numbers except $x = -20.000$ and $x = -18.000$, which corresponds to not factoring the denominator correctly.

All Real numbers except $x = -2.000$, which corresponds to removing only 1 value from the denominator.

All Real numbers except $x = -2.000$ and $x = -1.250$, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{All Real numbers.} \)

This corresponds to thinking the denominator has complex roots or that rational functions have a domain of all Real numbers.
