Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{4x^{2} +25 x + 25}{8x^{3} +6 x^{2} -65 x -75} \]The solution is \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 0 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote at } y = -5.000 \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as horizontal asymptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 0.500  \)

This corresponds to using rule for Horizontal Asymptote when degree of numerator and denominator match.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 0 \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 0.500 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x -11 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote.
\item \( \text{Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x -11. \)

This corresponds to flipping the numerator and denominator, then using synthetic division to find the oblique asymptote.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a Horizontal Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to the degree of the denominator. We have an Oblique Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. We cannot have both!

\litem{

\[ f(x) = \frac{4x^{3} +12 x^{2} -x -15}{8x^{2} +22 x + 15} \]The solution is \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.25 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.5 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as holes.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to factor the numerator and denominator. Any factors that cancel are holes in the function. The zeros left in the denominator are the vertical asymptotes.
