\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 6} \frac{\sqrt{5x - 14} - 4}{6x - 36} \]The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 0.373 \)

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( 0.125 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 0.021 \)

You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.104.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General comments:} It is difficult to imagine the graph of this function, so you need to test values close to $x = 6$.

\litem{
Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

\begin{center}
    \textit{ As $x$ approaches $5$, $f(x)$ approaches $\infty$. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( f(x) \text{ is undefined when } x \text{ is close to or exactly } 5. \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f(x) \text{ is undefined when } x \text{ is close to or exactly } 5. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } 5 \text{ when } x \text{ is large enough}. \)


\item \( x \text{ is undefined when } f(x) \text{ is close to or exactly } \infty. \)


\item \( \text{None of the above are always true.} \)


\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The limit tells you what happens as the $x$-values approach $5$. It says \textbf{absolutely nothing} about what is happening exactly at $f(5)$!

For the graph below, find the value(s) $a$ that makes the statement true: $ \displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$ does not exist.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 4 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{4}{x} - 1}{x - 4} \]The solution is \( \{ 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010, 4.0001 \} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 4.0100, 4.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 4.0000, 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 4 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 3.9000, 3.9900, 3.9990, 3.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 4 on the left.
\item \( \{ 4.1000, 4.0100, 4.0010, 4.0001 \} \)

This is correct!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$

Based on the information below, which of the following statements is always true?

    \textit{ As $x$ approaches $\infty$, $f(x)$ approaches $6.955$. }

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 2 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
