Which of the following intervals describes the Domain of the function below?
\[ f(x) = -\log_2{(x-4)}+8 \]The solution is \( (4, \infty) \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (-\infty, a), a \in [-6.3, -2.6] \)

$(-\infty, -4)$, which corresponds to flipping the Domain. Remember: the general for is $a*\log(x-h)+k$, \textbf{where $a$ does not affect the domain}.
\item \( [a, \infty), a \in [7.5, 9.8] \)

$[8, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift when shifting the Domain AND including the endpoint.
\item \( (a, \infty), a \in [3.4, 4.8] \)

* $(4, \infty)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( (-\infty, a], a \in [-10.6, -4.1] \)

$(-\infty, -8]$, which corresponds to using the negative vertical shift AND including the endpoint AND flipping the domain.
\item \( (-\infty, \infty) \)

This corresponds to thinking of the range of the log function (or the domain of the exponential function).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments}: The domain of a basic logarithmic function is $(0, \infty)$ and the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$. We can use shifts when finding the Domain, but the Range will always be all Real numbers.
