Which of the following intervals describes the Range of the function below?
\[ f(x) = \log_2{(x+8)}+3 \]The solution is \( (\infty, \infty) \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [a, \infty), a \in [7, 12] \)

$[8, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the negative of the horizontal shift AND including the endpoint.
\item \( (-\infty, a), a \in [3, 4] \)

$(-\infty, 3)$, which corresponds to using the vertical shift while the Range is $(-\infty, \infty)$.
\item \( (-\infty, a), a \in [-4, -1] \)

$(-\infty, -3)$, which corresponds to using the using the negative of vertical shift on $(0, \infty)$.
\item \( [a, \infty), a \in [-8, -7] \)

$[3, \infty)$, which corresponds to using the flipped Domain AND including the endpoint.
\item \( (-\infty, \infty) \)

*This is the correct option.
