\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (2 - 6 i)(-8 + 10 i) \]The solution is \( 44 + 68 i \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-80, -70] \text{ and } b \in [25, 31] \)

 $-76 + 28 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [36, 45] \text{ and } b \in [-70, -64] \)

 $44 - 68 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [36, 45] \text{ and } b \in [68, 73] \)

* $44 + 68 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-16, -12] \text{ and } b \in [-65, -58] \)

 $-16 - 60 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-80, -70] \text{ and } b \in [-28, -23] \)

 $-76 - 28 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ -\sqrt{\frac{3969}{49}} \]The solution is \( \text{Integer} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-63$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-5 + 7 i)(6 - 8 i) \]The solution is \( 26 + 82 i \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-91, -85] \text{ and } b \in [-3, -1] \)

 $-86 - 2 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [-38, -26] \text{ and } b \in [-59, -54] \)

 $-30 - 56 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [26, 29] \text{ and } b \in [79, 86] \)

* $26 + 82 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-91, -85] \text{ and } b \in [2, 5] \)

 $-86 + 2 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [26, 29] \text{ and } b \in [-89, -79] \)

 $26 - 82 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{-27 + 77 i}{8 + 5 i} \]The solution is \( 1.90  + 8.44 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-5, -3] \text{ and } b \in [15, 16.5] \)

 $-3.38  + 15.40 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [1, 2.5] \text{ and } b \in [6, 9.5] \)

* $1.90  + 8.44 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [1, 2.5] \text{ and } b \in [750.5, 751.5] \)

 $1.90  + 751.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [-7, -6.5] \text{ and } b \in [4, 6.5] \)

 $-6.75  + 5.40 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [168.5, 170] \text{ and } b \in [6, 9.5] \)

 $169.00  + 8.44 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{72 + 55 i}{4 + i} \]The solution is \( 20.18  + 8.71 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [342.5, 344] \text{ and } b \in [8, 10.5] \)

 $343.00  + 8.71 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\item \( a \in [20, 21.5] \text{ and } b \in [8, 10.5] \)

* $20.18  + 8.71 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [20, 21.5] \text{ and } b \in [147.5, 149] \)

 $20.18  + 148.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [13, 14.5] \text{ and } b \in [15.5, 18] \)

 $13.71  + 17.18 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [17, 18.5] \text{ and } b \in [54.5, 56] \)

 $18.00  + 55.00 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{81}{0}}+\sqrt{90} i \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

* This is the correct option!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 8 - 10 \div 20 * 13 - (6 * 7) \]The solution is \( -40.500 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-31.9, -28.9] \)

 -31.500, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( [47, 50.8] \)

 49.962, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [-42.5, -38.3] \)

* -40.500, which is the correct option.
\item \( [-38.4, -32.8] \)

 -34.038, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
