\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (8 - 4 i)(-3 + 2 i) \]The solution is \( -16 + 28 i \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-18, -14] \text{ and } b \in [25, 37] \)

* $-16 + 28 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-38, -31] \text{ and } b \in [-4, -2] \)

 $-32 - 4 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [-38, -31] \text{ and } b \in [3, 5] \)

 $-32 + 4 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [-18, -14] \text{ and } b \in [-31, -23] \)

 $-16 - 28 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-26, -17] \text{ and } b \in [-9, -6] \)

 $-24 - 8 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{2145}{11}} \]The solution is \( \text{Irrational} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

These are Nonreal Complex numbers \textbf{OR} things that are not numbers (e.g., dividing by 0).
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $\sqrt{195}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (5 - 4 i)(-2 - 7 i) \]The solution is \( -38 - 27 i \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-10, -5] \text{ and } b \in [27.12, 28.4] \)

 $-10 + 28 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [17, 23] \text{ and } b \in [41.94, 43.43] \)

 $18 + 43 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.
\item \( a \in [17, 23] \text{ and } b \in [-45.09, -41.71] \)

 $18 - 43 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [-40, -37] \text{ and } b \in [26.67, 27.02] \)

 $-38 + 27 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-40, -37] \text{ and } b \in [-28.56, -26.7] \)

* $-38 - 27 i$, which is the correct option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.

\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{63 - 55 i}{4 - 6 i} \]The solution is \( 11.19  + 3.04 i \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [14.5, 16.5] \text{ and } b \in [8.5, 10] \)

 $15.75  + 9.17 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.
\item \( a \in [-2, -1] \text{ and } b \in [-13.5, -11] \)

 $-1.50  - 11.50 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [10, 11.5] \text{ and } b \in [157, 158.5] \)

 $11.19  + 158.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\item \( a \in [10, 11.5] \text{ and } b \in [1.5, 4.5] \)

* $11.19  + 3.04 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [581.5, 582.5] \text{ and } b \in [1.5, 4.5] \)

 $582.00  + 3.04 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ \frac{-27 - 11 i}{5 + 8 i} \]The solution is \( -2.51  + 1.81 i \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-6, -5] \text{ and } b \in [-2, 0] \)

* $-2.51  + 1.81 i$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-1.5, 0] \text{ and } b \in [-4, -2] \)

 $-0.53  - 3.04 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and not computing the conjugate correctly.
\item \( a \in [-224, -222] \text{ and } b \in [0, 2.5] \)

 $-223.00  + 1.81 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\item \( a \in [-3, -1] \text{ and } b \in [160, 161.5] \)

 $-2.51  + 161.00 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
}
\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \frac{\sqrt{119}}{9}+\sqrt{-6}i \]The solution is \( \text{Irrational} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

* This is the correct option!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 13 - 17 \div 14 * 19 - (7 * 12) \]The solution is \( -94.071 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-205.86, -201.86] \)

 -204.857, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( [-76.06, -68.06] \)

 -71.064, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( [94.94, 98.94] \)

 96.936, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [-100.07, -90.07] \)

* -94.071, which is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.
