Determine the vertical asymptotes and holes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{4x^{3} +4 x^{2} -33 x -45}{6x^{2} -x -15} \]The solution is \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.667 \text{ and hole at } x = -1.5 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = -1.5 \text{ with no holes.} \)

This corresponds to not factoring out the hole.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = -2.5 \text{ with a hole at } x = -1.5 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.
