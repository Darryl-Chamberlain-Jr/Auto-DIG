Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ \frac{5}{7} + \frac{4}{3} x \geq \frac{10}{8} x - \frac{9}{9} \]The solution is \( [-20.571, \infty) \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [-21, -20.25] \)

 $(-\infty, -20.571]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative!
\item \( [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-22.5, -17.25] \)

* $[-20.571, \infty)$, which is the correct option.
\item \( [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [18.75, 22.5] \)

 $[20.571, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution.
\item \( (-\infty, a], \text{ where } a \in [18, 23.25] \)

 $(-\infty, 20.571]$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly.
\item \( \text{None of the above}. \)

You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
\[ \text{ More than } 9 \text{ units from the number } 4. \]The solution is \( (-\infty, -5) \cup (13, \infty) \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

This describes the values less than 9 from 4

This describes the values no more than 9 from 4
\item \( (-\infty, -5) \cup (13, \infty) \)

This describes the values more than 9 from 4
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

You likely thought the values in the interval were not correct.

\item \( (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.75, 4.5] \text{ and } b \in [5.25, 12.75] \)

\item \( (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [2.25, 4.5] \text{ and } b \in [3.75, 9.75] \)
