You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.375.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 10 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{10}{x} - 1}{x - 10} \]The solution is \( \{ 10.1000, 10.0100, 10.0010, 10.0001 \} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 10.0000, 9.9000, 9.9900, 9.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 10 doesn't help us estimate the limit.

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 9.9000, 9.9900, 9.9990, 9.9999 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 10 on the left.
\item \( \{ 10.0000, 10.1000, 10.0100, 10.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 10 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 9.9000, 9.9900, 10.0100, 10.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
