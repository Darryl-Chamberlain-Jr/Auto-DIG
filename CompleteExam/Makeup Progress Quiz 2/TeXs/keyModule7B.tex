\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.

Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{98}{-42x + 70} + 1 = \frac{98}{-42x + 70} \]The solution is \( \text{all solutions are invalid or lead to complex values in the equation.} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x_1 \in [-2.67, 0.33] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.33,2.67] \)

$x = -1.667 \text{ and } x = 1.667$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [-2.67,0.33] \)

$x = -1.667$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-42x + 70$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

*$x = 1.667$ leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution, which is the correct option.
\item \( x \in [0.67,2.67] \)

$x = 1.667$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
\item \( x_1 \in [0.67, 2.67] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.33,2.67] \)

$x = 1.667 \text{ and } x = 1.667$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
