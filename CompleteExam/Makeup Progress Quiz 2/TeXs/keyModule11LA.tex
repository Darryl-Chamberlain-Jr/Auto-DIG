You likely learned L'Hospital's Rule in a previous course, but misapplied it here.

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.
\item \( 0.125 \)

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.047.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 8 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{8}{x} - 1}{x - 8} \]The solution is \( \{ 7.9000, 7.9900, 7.9990, 7.9999 \} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 7.9000, 7.9900, 8.0100, 8.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 8.1000, 8.0100, 8.0010, 8.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 8 on the right.
\item \( \{ 8.0000, 7.9000, 7.9900, 7.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 8 doesn't help us estimate the limit.

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 8 doesn't help us estimate the limit.

\textbf{General Comment:} \textbf{General Comments:} To evaluate a one-sided limit, we want to put numbers close to the limit. We can't use the limit value itself if it results in $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$
