Choose the model type that would best describe the scenario below.
\begin{center}
    \textit{ In economics, there are two common equations to model interest earned. The compound interest formula is $A = P (1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$, where $A$ is the amount of money you end up with, $P$ is your starting money, $r$ is the interest rate, $n$ is the number of times compounded in a year, and $t$ is the total number of years. For example, if you were a parent and wanted to save \$10,000 in 3 years-time at 3.5\% interest compounded monthly, you would need to invest about \$9,000. }
