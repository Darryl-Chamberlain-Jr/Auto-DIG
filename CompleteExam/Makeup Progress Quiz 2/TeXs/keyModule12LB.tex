\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{9x^{3} +36 x^{2} +44 x + 16}{3x^{3} +20 x^{2} +48 x + 32} \]The solution is \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.000  \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 3.000  \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 0  \)

This corresponds to using the rule for Horizontal Asymptote when the degree of the denominator is larger than the numerator.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } y = -2  \)

This corresponds to the hole at $x = -2$.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

This corresponds to believing there should be an oblique asymptote.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } y = -4.000  \)

This corresponds to the hole at $x = -4.000$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a Horizontal Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is smaller than or equal to the degree of the denominator. We have an Oblique Asymptote if the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. We cannot have both!

\litem{
Determine the vertical asymptotes and holes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{16x^{3} -16 x^{2} -25 x + 25}{12x^{2} +x -20} \]The solution is \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.333 \text{ and hole at } x = 1.25 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Holes at } x = -1.333 \text{ and } x = 1.25 \text{ with no vertical asymptotes.} \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as holes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = -1.333 \text{ and hole at } x = 1.25 \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptote of } x = 1.333 \text{ and hole at } x = 1.25 \)

This corresponds to mixing vertical and horizontal asymptotes.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.333 \text{ and } x = -1.25 \text{ with a hole at } x = 1.25 \)

This corresponds to setting the numerator equal to 0.
\item \( \text{Vertical Asymptotes of } x = -1.333 \text{ and } x = 1.25 \text{ with no holes.} \)

This corresponds to not factoring out the hole.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember to factor the numerator and denominator. Any factors that cancel are holes in the function. The zeros left in the denominator are the vertical asymptotes.
