For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$ to find the coefficient for the model of the new volume $V_{\text{new}} = k r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pepsi wants to increase the volume of soda in their cans. They've decided to increase the radius by 11 percent and increase the height by 15 percent. They want to model the new volume based on the radius and height of the original cans. }

The solution is \( k = 4.45137 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = 0.00181 \)

This corresponds to the model: $V = (0.11 r)^2 (0.15 h)$.
\item \( k = 1.41692 \)

This corresponds to the model: $V = (1.11 r)^2 (1.15 h)$.
\item \( k = 0.00570 \)

This corresponds to the model: $V = \pi (0.11 r)^2 (0.15 h)$.
\item \( k = 4.45137 \)

* This is the correct option and corresponds to the model: $V = \pi (1.11 r)^2 (1.15 h)$.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

If you chose this, please talk with the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the options are correct.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When calculating the new dimensions, you need to add/subtract from 100\%. For example, a 10\% increase in height would result in 110\% of the original height: $1.1h_{old} = h_{new}$.

A town has an initial population of 30000. The town's population for the next 9 years is provided below. Which type of function would be most appropriate to model the town's population?

This suggests a constant growth. You would be able to add or subtract the same amount year-to-year if this is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Logarithmic} \)

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?
