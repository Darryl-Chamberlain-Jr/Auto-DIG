\textbf{This key should allow you to understand why you choose the option you did (beyond just getting a question right or wrong). \href{https://xronos.clas.ufl.edu/mac1105spring2020/courseDescriptionAndMisc/Exams/LearningFromResults}{More instructions on how to use this key can be found here}.}

\textbf{If you have a suggestion to make the keys better, \href{https://forms.gle/CZkbZmPbC9XALEE88}{please fill out the short survey here}.}

\textit{Note: This key is auto-generated and may contain issues and/or errors. The keys are reviewed after each exam to ensure grading is done accurately. If there are issues (like duplicate options), they are noted in the offline gradebook. The keys are a work-in-progress to give students as many resources to improve as possible.}

\begin{enumerate}\litem{
Simplify the expression below and choose the interval the simplification is contained within.
\[ 8 - 6 \div 16 * 12 - (18 * 2) \]The solution is \( -32.500 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( [-30.3, -28.4] \)

 -29.000, which corresponds to not distributing a negative correctly.
\item \( [43.6, 44.1] \)

 43.969, which corresponds to not distributing addition and subtraction correctly.
\item \( [-32.9, -30] \)

* -32.500, which is the correct option.
\item \( [-28.5, -25.6] \)

 -28.031, which corresponds to an Order of Operations error: not reading left-to-right for multiplication/division.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

 You may have gotten this by making an unanticipated error. If you got a value that is not any of the others, please let the coordinator know so they can help you figure out what happened.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} While you may remember (or were taught) PEMDAS is done in order, it is actually done as P/E/MD/AS. When we are at MD or AS, we read left to right.

\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{24}{0}} \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Real number} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

These are the counting numbers with 0 (0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Integer} \)

These are the negative and positive counting numbers (..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $\sqrt{\frac{24}{0}}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.

Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Real numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{-1716}{13}} \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Real number} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

\litem{
Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.
\[ \sqrt{\frac{-1568}{14}}+\sqrt{0}i \]The solution is \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that is not Real (has $i$ as part of the number).
\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.
}
\litem{
Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (8 - 6 i)(-7 - 5 i) \]The solution is \( -86 + 2 i \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-28, -18] \text{ and } b \in [81, 84] \)

 $-26 + 82 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.

 $-86 - 2 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-56, -53] \text{ and } b \in [29, 33] \)

 $-56 + 30 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-28, -18] \text{ and } b \in [-85, -80] \)

 $-26 - 82 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the first term.
\item \( a \in [-87, -83] \text{ and } b \in [0, 5] \)

* $-86 + 2 i$, which is the correct option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.

Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.

\item \( a \in [-17, -14] \text{ and } b \in [1, 4] \)

 $-15.00  + 2.75 i$, which corresponds to just dividing the first term by the first term and the second by the second.

\item \( a \in [-91.5, -90] \text{ and } b \in [-9.5, -8] \)

 $-91.00  - 8.52 i$, which corresponds to forgetting to multiply the conjugate by the numerator and using a plus instead of a minus in the denominator.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Multiply the numerator and denominator by the *conjugate* of the denominator, then simplify. For example, if we have $2+3i$, the conjugate is $2-3i$.
