\item \( x_1 \in [-9.26, -8.66] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.62, -0.53] \)

$x_1 = -9.000 \text{ and } x_2 = -0.600$, which corresponds to solving the factored version $(x + 9)(10x + 6)$
\item \( x_1 \in [-4.2, -3.05] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.52, -1.39] \)

$x_1 = -3.600 \text{ and } x_2 = -1.500$, which corresponds to solving the factored version $(5x + 18)(2x + 3)$
\item \( x_1 \in [-14.3, -13.15] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-0.49, -0.39] \)

$x_1 = -13.500 \text{ and } x_2 = -0.400$, which corresponds to solving the factored version $(2x + 27)(5x + 2)$
\item \( x_1 \in [-4.83, -3.98] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.44, -1.11] \)

* $x_1 = -4.500 \text{ and } x_2 = -1.200$, which is the correct option. Obtained by solving the factored version $(2x + 9)(5x + 6)$
\item \( x_1 \in [-45.02, -44.91] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-12.01, -11.94] \)

$x_1 = -45.000 \text{ and } x_2 = -12.000$, which corresponds to solving the factored version $(x + 45)(x + 12)$

\textbf{General Comment:} This question can be factored, but it may be faster to find the solutions via the Quadratic Equation.
