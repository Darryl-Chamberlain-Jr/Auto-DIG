Choose the graph of the equation below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{-1}{x - 3} + 1 \]The solution is the graph below, which is option C.

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that the general form of a basic rational equation is $ f(x) = \frac{a}{(x-h)^n} + k$, where $a$ is the leading coefficient (and in this case, we assume is either $1$ or $-1$), $n$ is the degree (in this case, either $1$ or $2$), and $(h, k)$ is the intersection of the asymptotes.

\litem{
Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.
\[ \frac{-3}{-9x + 9} + 2 = \frac{9}{81x -81} \]The solution is \( x = 0.889 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

This corresponds to thinking $x = 0.889$ leads to dividing by zero in the original equation, which it does not.
\item \( x \in [0.89,1.89] \)

* $x = 0.889$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x_1 \in [-0.8, 0.5] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.11,2.89] \)

$x = 0.333 \text{ and } x = 0.889$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [-2.8,-0.5] \)

$x = -1.111$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-9x + 9$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( x_1 \in [-2.8, -0.5] \text{ and } x_2 \in [-1.11,2.89] \)

$x = -1.111 \text{ and } x = 0.889$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.

\textbf{General Comment:} Distractors are different based on the number of solutions. Remember that after solving, we need to make sure our solution does not make the original equation divide by zero!

Solve the rational equation below. Then, choose the interval(s) that the solution(s) belongs to.

$x = -0.250 \text{ and } x = 0.250$, which corresponds to getting the correct solution and believing there should be a second solution to the equation.
\item \( x \in [-0.7,-0.1] \)

$x = -0.250$, which corresponds to not distributing the factor $-72x + 18$ correctly when trying to eliminate the fraction.
\item \( \text{All solutions lead to invalid or complex values in the equation.} \)

*$x = 0.250$ leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution, which is the correct option.
\item \( x \in [-0.75,1.25] \)

$x = 0.250$, which corresponds to not checking if this value leads to dividing by 0 in the original equation and thus is not a valid solution.
\item \( x_1 \in [0.1, 0.9] \text{ and } x_2 \in [0.25,4.25] \)
