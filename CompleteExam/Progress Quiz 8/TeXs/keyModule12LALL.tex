Determine the horizontal and/or oblique asymptotes in the rational function below.
\[ f(x) = \frac{6x^{3} +29 x^{2} -5 x -100}{3x^{2} +10 x -25} \]The solution is \( y = 2x + 3 \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 2.0  \)

This corresponds to using rule for Horizontal Asymptote when degree of numerator and denominator match.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = 2.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x + 3 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote.
\item \( \text{Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x + 3. \)

This is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote of } y = -5.0 \text{ and Oblique Asymptote of } y = 2x + 3 \)

This corresponds to believing there can be both a horizontal and oblique asymptote AND mixing up horizontal/vertical asymoptote.
\item \( \text{Horizontal Asymptote at } y = -5.0 \)

This corresponds to considering where the denominator is equal to 0 as horizontal asymptote.
