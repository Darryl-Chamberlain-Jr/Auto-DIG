Solve the modeling problem below, if possible.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ A new virus is spreading throughout the world. There were initially 6 many cases reported, but the number of confirmed cases has quadrupled every 4 days. How long will it be until there are at least 1000 confirmed cases? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 15 \text{ days} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 9 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation correctly but did not apply the properties of log correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 21 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base, but solved correctly otherwise.
\item \( \text{About } 15 \text{ days} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 10 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base and did not apply the properties of log correctly.
\item \( \text{There is not enough information to solve the problem.} \)

If you chose this option, please contact the coordinator to discuss why you think this is the case.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Set up the model the same as in Module 11M. Then, plug in 1000 and solve for $d$ in your model.

Solve the modeling problem below, if possible.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ A new virus is spreading throughout the world. There were initially 5 many cases reported, but the number of confirmed cases has doubled every 4 days. How long will it be until there are at least 10000 confirmed cases? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 44 \text{ days} \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 15 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base and did not apply the properties of log correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 44 \text{ days} \)

\item \( \text{About } 31 \text{ days} \)

You modeled the situation with $e$ as the base, but solved correctly otherwise.

For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 26 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 8 \text{ percent} \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 8 \text{ percent} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{About } 3 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
\item \( \text{About } 13 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 12 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that when plugging the increases of values in, you need to treat it as that percentage above 100. For example, a 5 percent increase means 105 percent.
}
\litem{
For the scenario below, model the rate of vibration (cm/s) of the string in terms of the length of the string. Then determine the variation constant $k$ of the model (if possible). The constant should be in terms of cm and s.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ The rate of vibration of a string under constant tension varies based on the type of string and the length of the string. The rate of vibration of string $\omega$ decreases as the cube length of the string increases. For example, when string $\omega$ is 2 mm long, the rate of vibration is 29 cm/s. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( k = 0.23 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = 0.23 \)

* This is the correct option, which corresponds to the model $R = \frac{k}{l^{3}}$ AND converts from mm to cm.
\item \( k = 3.62 \)

This option uses the model $R = kl^{3}$ as if this is a direct variation AND does not convert from mm to cm so that the units match.
\item \( k = 3625.00 \)

This option uses the model $R = kl^{3}$ as if this is a direct variation.
\item \( k = 232.00 \)

This option uses the correct model, $R = \frac{k}{l^{3}}$, but does not convert from mm to cm so that the units match.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

Talk with the coordinator if you chose this option.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The most common mistake on this question is to not convert mm to cm! When modeling, you need to make sure all of the units for your variables are compatible.

\litem{
Solve the modeling problem below, if possible.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ In CHM2045L, Brittany created a 24 liter 20 percent solution of chemical $\chi$ using two different solution percentages of chemical $\chi$. When she went to write her lab report, she realized she forgot to write the amount of each solution she used! If she remembers she used 18 percent and 33 percent solutions, what was the amount she used of the 33 percent solution? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( 3.20 liters \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 3.20 liters \)

*This is the correct option.
\item \( 12.34 liters \)

This was a random value. If this was not a guess, contact the coordinator to talk about how you got this value.
\item \( 20.80 liters \)

This is the concentration of 18 percent solution.
\item \( 12.00 liters \)

This would be correct if Brittany used equal parts of each solution.
\item \( \text{There is not enough information to solve the problem.} \)

You may have chose this if you thought you needed to know how much of the second solution was used in the problem. Remember that the total minus the first solution would give you the second amount used.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Build the model exactly as you did in Module 9M. Then, solve for the volume you are looking for.

\litem{
Determine the appropriate model for the graph of points below.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{../Figures/identifyModelGraph12A.png}
\end{center}


The solution is \( \text{Non-linear Power model} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Exponential model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want an extremely slow change early, then a rapid change later.
\item \( \text{Linear model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a mostly straight line of points.
\item \( \text{Non-linear Power model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we need to see a polynomial or rational shape.
\item \( \text{Logarithmic model} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want a rapid change early, then an extremely slow change later.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

For this to be the correct option, we want to see no pattern in the points.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This question is testing if you can associate the models with their graphical representation. If you are having trouble, go back to the corresponding Core module to learn about the specific function you are having trouble recognizing.
}
\litem{
For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$ to find the coefficient for the model of the new volume $V_{\text{new}} = k r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pepsi wants to increase the volume of soda in their cans. They've decided to increase the radius by 12 percent and increase the height by 15 percent. They want to model the new volume based on the radius and height of the original cans. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( k = 4.53194 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = 0.00216 \)

This corresponds to the model: $V = (0.12 r)^2 (0.15 h)$.
\item \( k = 4.53194 \)

* This is the correct option and corresponds to the model: $V = \pi (1.12 r)^2 (1.15 h)$.
\item \( k = 1.44256 \)

This corresponds to the model: $V = (1.12 r)^2 (1.15 h)$.
\item \( k = 0.00679 \)

This corresponds to the model: $V = \pi (0.12 r)^2 (0.15 h)$.
\item \( \text{None of the above.} \)

If you chose this, please talk with the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the options are correct.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When calculating the new dimensions, you need to add/subtract from 100\%. For example, a 10\% increase in height would result in 110\% of the original height: $1.1h_{old} = h_{new}$.
}
\litem{
For the scenario below, use the model for the volume of a cylinder as $V = \pi r^2 h$.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Pringles wants to add 48 \text{percent} more chips to their cylinder cans and minimize the design change of their cans. They've decided that the best way to minimize the design change is to increase the radius and height by the same percentage. What should this increase be? }
\end{center}
The solution is \( \text{About } 14 \text{ percent} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 22 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to solving correctly but treating both radius and height as equal contributors to the volume.
\item \( \text{About } 4 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to not solving for the increase properly.
\item \( \text{About } 24 \text{ percent} \)

This corresponds to treating both radius and height as equal contributors and not solving correctly.
\item \( \text{About } 14 \text{ percent} \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discus how you solved the problem.

If she remembers she used 20 percent and 42 percent solutions, what was the amount she used of the 20 percent solution? }

The solution is \( 6.05 liters \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( 11.11 liters \)

This was a random value. If this was not a guess, contact the coordinator to talk about how you got this value.
