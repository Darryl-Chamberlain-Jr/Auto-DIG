Find the inverse of the function below (if it exists). Then, evaluate the inverse at $x = -14$ and choose the interval that $f^-1(-14)$ belongs to.
\[ f(x) = 3 x^2 + 5 \]The solution is \( \text{ The function is not invertible for all Real numbers. } \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( f^{-1}(-14) \in [2.77, 3.81] \)

 Distractor 3: This corresponds to finding the (nonexistent) inverse and dividing by a negative.
\item \( f^{-1}(-14) \in [2.33, 3.07] \)

 Distractor 1: This corresponds to trying to find the inverse even though the function is not 1-1.

 Distractor 4: This corresponds to both distractors 2 and 3.
\item \( f^{-1}(-14) \in [0.99, 1.76] \)

 Distractor 2: This corresponds to finding the (nonexistent) inverse and not subtracting by the vertical shift.
\item \( \text{ The function is not invertible for all Real numbers. } \)

* This is the correct option.

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure you check that the function is 1-1 before trying to find the inverse!
