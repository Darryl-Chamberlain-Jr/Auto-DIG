The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.

\begin{center}
    \textit{ Uranium is taken out of the reactor with a temperature of $200^{\circ}$ C and is placed into a $20^{\circ}$ C bath to cool. After 30 minutes, the uranium has cooled to $139^{\circ}$ C. }
\end{center}
The solution is \( k = -0.01379 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( k = -0.01731 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ correctly.
\item \( k = -0.02572 \)

This uses $A$ correctly but solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.02529 \)

This uses $A$ as the initial temperature and solves for $k$ incorrectly.
\item \( k = -0.01379 \)

* This is the correct option.
\item \( \text{None of the above} \)

If you chose this, please contact the coordinator to discuss why you believe none of the other answers are correct.

\textbf{General Comment:} The initial temperature is when $t = 0$. Unlike power models, that means $A$ is not the initial temperature!

A town has an initial population of 100000. The town's population for the next 10 years is provided below. Which type of function would be most appropriate to model the town's population?

\item \( \text{Linear} \)

This suggests a constant growth. You would be able to add or subtract the same amount year-to-year if this is the correct answer.
\item \( \text{Non-Linear Power} \)

This suggests a growth faster than constant but slower than exponential.
\item \( \text{Exponential} \)

This suggests the fastest of growths that we know.

This suggests the slowest of growths that we know.

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?

The solution is \( \text{None of the above} \), which is option E.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{About } 23 \text{ minutes} \)

This uses the wrong base.
\item \( \text{About } 251 \text{ minutes} \)

This uses the wrong base, does not solve for the constant correctly, AND converted incorrectly.

\textbf{General Comment:} Your model should be $P(t) = P_0(b)^{kt}$, where $P(t)$ is the population at some time $t$, $P_0$ is the initial population, and $k$ is the replication rate. Be sure you convert the hours into minutes!

\textbf{General Comment:} We are trying to compare the growth rate of the population. Growth rates can be characterized from slowest to fastest as: logarithmic, indirect, linear, direct, exponential. The best way to approach this is to first compare it to linear (is it linear, faster than linear, or slower than linear)? If faster, is it as fast as exponential? If slower, is it as slow as logarithmic?

The temperature of an object, $T$, in a different surrounding temperature $T_s$ will behave according to the formula $T(t) = Ae^{kt} + T_s$, where $t$ is minutes, $A$ is a constant, and k is a constant. Use this formula and the situation below to construct a model that describes the uranium's temperature, $T$, based on the amount of time t (in minutes) that have passed. Choose the correct constant $k$ from the options below.
