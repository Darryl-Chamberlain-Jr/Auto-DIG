Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ 4 + 8 x > 11 x \text{ or } 5 + 3 x < 5 x \]The solution is \( (-\infty, 1.333) \text{ or } (2.5, \infty) \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.25, 3.75] \text{ and } b \in [0, 5.25] \)

Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded).
\item \( (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-7.5, -2.25] \text{ and } b \in [-6.75, 0.75] \)

Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating.
\item \( (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-0.75, 3.75] \text{ and } b \in [2.25, 3.75] \)

 * Correct option.
\item \( (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-4.5, -1.5] \text{ and } b \in [-5.25, 2.25] \)

Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution.
\item \( (-\infty, \infty) \)

Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.

Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ \frac{-6}{9} - \frac{7}{7} x \leq \frac{-5}{2} x + \frac{8}{8} \]The solution is \( (-\infty, 1.111] \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

\item \( [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [0, 2.25] \)

 $[1.111, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative!
\item \( [a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-2.25, 0] \)

 $[-1.111, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly.
\item \( \text{None of the above}. \)

You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals.

\textbf{General Comment:} Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative.

$(-\infty, 2.75] \cup (-10.25, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints.

\textbf{General Comment:} To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution.
