\item \( x_1 \in [-22.45, -21.84] \text{ and } x_2 \in [22.52, 23.78] \)

 $x_1 = -22.400 \text{ and } x_2 = 22.900$, which corresponds to writing the Quadratic Formula as $-\frac{b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}$.
\item \( \text{There are no Real solutions.} \)

Corresponds to getting a negative under the radical or believing that since the quadratic cannot be factored, it has no Real solutions.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} This requires Quadratic Formula. Just be sure to use the correct formula and watch your signs.

Write the equation of the graph presented below in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$, assuming  $a=1$ or $a=-1$. Then, choose the intervals that $a, b,$ and $c$ belong to.

The solution is \( f(x) = -x^{2} -4 x + 6 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-1.1, -0.4], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [3, 6], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [-15, -10] \)

$f(x)=-x^{2} +4 x -14$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2 - k$.
\item \( a \in [0.8, 2.9], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [3, 6], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [10, 15] \)

$f(x)=x^{2} +4 x + 14$, which corresponds to making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
\item \( a \in [0.8, 2.9], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-4, -1], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [10, 15] \)

$f(x)=x^{2} -4 x + 14$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$ AND making $a$ the opposite sign than it should be.
\item \( a \in [-1.1, -0.4], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [-4, -1], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [4, 7] \)

* $f(x)=-x^{2} -4 x + 6$, which is the correct option.
\item \( a \in [-1.1, -0.4], \hspace*{5mm} b \in [3, 6], \text{ and } \hspace*{5mm} c \in [4, 7] \)

$f(x)=-x^{2} +4 x + 6$, which corresponds to incorrectly using vertex form as $f(x) = a(x+h)^2+k$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} When the graph is pointing up, $a=1$. When the graph is pointing down, $a=-1$. Be sure to use Vertex Form: $y = a(x-h)^2+k$.
