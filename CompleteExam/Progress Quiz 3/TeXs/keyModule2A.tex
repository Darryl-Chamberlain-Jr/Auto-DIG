Find the equation of the line described below. Write the linear equation in the form $ y=mx+b $ and choose the intervals that contain $m$ and $b$.
\[ \text{Perpendicular to } 3 x + 4 y = 15 \text{ and passing through the point } (8, 10). \]The solution is \( y = 1.33x - 0.67 \), which is option B.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( m \in [-1.82, -1.19] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [19.7, 22.4] \)

 $y = -1.33x + 20.67$, which corresponds to using the negative slope.
\item \( m \in [0.87, 1.78] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [-1.9, -0.6] \)

* $y = 1.33x - 0.67$, which is the correct option.
\item \( m \in [0.87, 1.78] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [-0.3, 1.1] \)

 $y = 1.33x + 0.67$, which corresponds to using the correct slope and getting the negative $y$-intercept.
\item \( m \in [0.87, 1.78] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [1.9, 3] \)

 $y = 1.33x + 2.00$, which corresponds to correct slope and mis-distributing while simplifying to slope-intercept form.
\item \( m \in [-0.26, 0.92] \hspace*{3mm} b \in [-1.9, -0.6] \)

 $y = 0.75x - 0.67$, which corresponds to using the reciprocal slope $(1/m)$.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Parallel slope is the same and perpendicular slope is opposite reciprocal. Opposite reciprocal means flipping the fraction and changing the sign (positive to negative or negative to positive).

\litem{
Solve the equation below. Then, choose the interval that contains the solution.
\[ -11(12x + 4) = -3(13x -5) \]The solution is \( x = -0.634 \), which is option A.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( x \in [-0.96, -0.63] \)

* $x = -0.634$, which is the correct option.
\item \( x \in [-0.1, 0.58] \)

$x = 0.312$, which corresponds to not distributing the negative in front of the first parentheses correctly.
\item \( x \in [-0.28, -0.02] \)

$x = -0.170$, which corresponds to getting the negative of the actual solution.
\item \( x \in [-0.61, -0.2] \)

$x = -0.312$, which corresponds to not distributing the negative in front of the second parentheses correctly.
\item \( \text{There are no real solutions.} \)

Corresponds to students thinking a fraction means there is no solution to the equation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} The most common mistake on this question is to not distribute the negative in front of the second fraction correctly. The best way to avoid this is putting the numerator in parentheses, which will help you remember to distribute the negative correctly.
