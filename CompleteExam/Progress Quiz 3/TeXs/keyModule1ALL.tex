\[ -\sqrt{\frac{14}{0}} \]The solution is \( \text{Not a Real number} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3)
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers.
\item \( \text{Not a Real number} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Whole} \)

\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} First, you \textbf{NEED} to simplify the expression. This question simplifies to $-\sqrt{\frac{14}{0}}$. 
 
 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.

Simplify the expression below into the form $a+bi$. Then, choose the intervals that $a$ and $b$ belong to.
\[ (-6 + 4 i)(9 - 3 i) \]The solution is \( -42 + 54 i \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-42, -38] \text{ and } b \in [-56, -50] \)

 $-42 - 54 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.
\item \( a \in [-68, -58] \text{ and } b \in [16, 19] \)

 $-66 + 18 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.

 $-54 - 12 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.

\textbf{General Comment:} You can treat $i$ as a variable and distribute. Just remember that $i^2=-1$, so you can continue to reduce after you distribute.
