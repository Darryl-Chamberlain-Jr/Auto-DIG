Choose the \textbf{smallest} set of Complex numbers that the number below belongs to.

\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Nonreal Complex} \)

* This is the correct option!
\item \( \text{Rational} \)

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)
\item \( \text{Pure Imaginary} \)

This is a Complex number $(a+bi)$ that \textbf{only} has an imaginary part like $2i$.
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to simplify $i^2 = -1$. This may remove the imaginary portion for your number. If you are having trouble, you may want to look at the \textit{Subgroups of the Real Numbers} section.

 $-42 + 46 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in the second term.

 $-24 - 18 i$, which corresponds to just multiplying the real terms to get the real part of the solution and the coefficients in the complex terms to get the complex part.
\item \( a \in [-11, -3] \text{ and } b \in [59, 64] \)

 $-6 + 62 i$, which corresponds to adding a minus sign in both terms.

\item \( \text{Not a Complex Number} \)

This is not a number. The only non-Complex number we know is dividing by 0 as this is not a number!
\item \( \text{Irrational} \)

These cannot be written as a fraction of Integers. Remember: $\pi$ is not an Integer!

These are numbers that can be written as fraction of Integers (e.g., -2/3 + 5)

 Be sure you look at the simplified fraction and not just the decimal expansion. Numbers such as 13, 17, and 19 provide \textbf{long but repeating/terminating decimal expansions!} 
 
 The only ways to *not* be a Real number are: dividing by 0 or taking the square root of a negative number. 
 
 Irrational numbers are more than just square root of 3: adding or subtracting values from square root of 3 is also irrational.
