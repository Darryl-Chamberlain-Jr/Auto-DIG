1. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ 3x -6 > 5x + 6 \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -6.0) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [3, 8] $ 

  $(6.0, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-10, 0] $ 

  $(-6.0, \infty)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [3, 8] $ 

  $(-\infty, 6.0)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-7, -5] $ 

 * $(-\infty, -6.0)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative. 

-----------------------------------------------

2. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ \frac{-6}{3} - \frac{9}{6} x < \frac{-8}{9} x - \frac{7}{8} \] 
The solution is $ (-1.841, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.3, -1.1] $ 

 * $(-1.841, \infty)$, which is the correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-1, 3] $ 

  $(-\infty, 1.841)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval AND negating the endpoint. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative as well as not moving values over to a side properly. 
\item $ (a, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [1.1, 3.6] $ 

  $(1.841, \infty)$, which corresponds to negating the endpoint of the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a), \text{ where } a \in [-5, 0] $ 

  $(-\infty, -1.841)$, which corresponds to switching the direction of the interval. You likely did this if you did not flip the inequality when dividing by a negative! 
\item $ \text{None of the above}. $ 

 You may have chosen this if you thought the inequality did not match the ends of the intervals. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: Remember that less/greater than or equal to includes the endpoint, while less/greater do not. Also, remember that you need to flip the inequality when you multiply or divide by a negative. 

-----------------------------------------------

3. Using an interval or intervals, describe all the $x$-values within or including a distance of the given values.
\[ \text{ Less than } 6 \text{ units from the number } 5. \] 
The solution is $ (-1, 11) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-1, 11) $ 

 This describes the values less than 6 from 5 
\item $ [-1, 11] $ 

 This describes the values no more than 6 from 5 
\item $ (-\infty, -1) \cup (11, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values more than 6 from 5 
\item $ (-\infty, -1] \cup [11, \infty) $ 

 This describes the values no less than 6 from 5 
\item $ \text{None of the above} $ 

 You likely thought the values in the interval were not correct. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: When thinking about this language, it helps to draw a number line and try points. 

-----------------------------------------------

4. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -9 + 9 x < \frac{59 x - 4}{6} \leq 9 + 6 x \] 
The solution is $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [7, 14] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 1] $ 

 $(-\infty, 10.00] \cup (-2.52, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality AND flipping the inequality AND getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [6, 11] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 0] $ 

 $(-\infty, 10.00) \cup [-2.52, \infty)$, which corresponds to displaying the and-inequality as an or-inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ (a, b], \text{ where } a \in [9, 16] \text{ and } b \in [-4, 0] $ 

 $(10.00, -2.52]$, which is the correct interval but negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ [a, b), \text{ where } a \in [5, 12] \text{ and } b \in [-5, -1] $ 

 $[10.00, -2.52)$, which corresponds to flipping the inequality and getting negatives of the actual endpoints. 
\item $ \text{None of the above.} $ 

 * This is correct as the answer should be $(-10.00, 2.52]$. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} To solve, you will need to break up the compound inequality into two inequalities. Be sure to keep track of the inequality! It may be best to draw a number line and graph your solution. 

-----------------------------------------------

0. Solve the linear inequality below. Then, choose the constant and interval combination that describes the solution set.
\[ -5 + 6 x > 7 x \text{ or } 9 + 8 x < 11 x \] 
The solution is $ (-\infty, -5.0) \text{ or } (3.0, \infty) $ 

\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.] 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.1, -2.5] \text{ and } b \in [3.9, 5.2] $ 

 Corresponds to inverting the inequality and negating the solution. 
\item $ (-\infty, a) \cup (b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5.2, -3.4] \text{ and } b \in [2.1, 3.8] $ 

  * Correct option. 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-5.4, -4.1] \text{ and } b \in [1.6, 4] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints (when they should be excluded). 
\item $ (-\infty, a] \cup [b, \infty), \text{ where } a \in [-3.8, -1] \text{ and } b \in [3.7, 5.7] $ 

 Corresponds to including the endpoints AND negating. 
\item $ (-\infty, \infty) $ 

 Corresponds to the variable canceling, which does not happen in this instance. 
\end{enumerate} 
 
\textbf{General Comment:} General Comments: When multiplying or dividing by a negative, flip the sign.
