What are the \textit{possible Rational} roots of the polynomial below?
\[ f(x) = 5x^{4} +3 x^{3} +6 x^{2} +2 x + 6 \]The solution is \( \text{ All combinations of: }\frac{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6}{\pm 1,\pm 5} \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \pm 1,\pm 5 \)

 Distractor 1: Corresponds to the plus or minus factors of a1 only.
\item \( \text{ All combinations of: }\frac{\pm 1,\pm 5}{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6} \)

 Distractor 3: Corresponds to the plus or minus of the inverse quotient (an/a0) of the factors. 
\item \( \pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6 \)

This would have been the solution \textbf{if asked for the possible Integer roots}!
\item \( \text{ All combinations of: }\frac{\pm 1,\pm 2,\pm 3,\pm 6}{\pm 1,\pm 5} \)

* This is the solution \textbf{since we asked for the possible Rational roots}!
\item \( \text{ There is no formula or theorem that tells us all possible Rational roots.} \)

 Distractor 4: Corresponds to not recalling the theorem for rational roots of a polynomial.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} We have a way to find the possible Rational roots. The possible Integer roots are the Integers in this list.

Perform the division below. Then, find the intervals that correspond to the quotient in the form $ax^2+bx+c$ and remainder $r$.
\[ \frac{10x^{3} -30 x + 18}{x + 2} \]The solution is \( 10x^{2} -20 x + 10 + \frac{-2}{x + 2} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( a \in [-20, -19], b \in [39, 42], c \in [-116, -107], \text{ and } r \in [237, 239]. \)

 You multipled by the synthetic number rather than bringing the first factor down.
\item \( a \in [6, 14], b \in [-34, -29], c \in [58, 61], \text{ and } r \in [-164, -161]. \)

 You multipled by the synthetic number and subtracted rather than adding during synthetic division.
\item \( a \in [6, 14], b \in [-23, -13], c \in [8, 15], \text{ and } r \in [-7, 1]. \)

* This is the solution!
\item \( a \in [-20, -19], b \in [-42, -39], c \in [-116, -107], \text{ and } r \in [-202, -197]. \)

 You divided by the opposite of the factor AND multipled the first factor rather than just bringing it down.
\item \( a \in [6, 14], b \in [14, 23], c \in [8, 15], \text{ and } r \in [36, 42]. \)

 You divided by the opposite of the factor.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{General Comment:} Be sure to synthetically divide by the zero of the denominator! Also, make sure to include 0 placeholders for missing terms.
