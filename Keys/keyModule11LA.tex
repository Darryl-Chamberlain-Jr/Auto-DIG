To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 2 from the left, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
\[ \frac{\frac{2}{x} - 1}{x - 2} \]The solution is \( \{ 1.9000, 1.9900, 1.9990, 1.9999 \} \), which is option C.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
\item \( \{ 2.1000, 2.0100, 2.0010, 2.0001 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit of 2 on the right.
\item \( \{ 2.0000, 2.1000, 2.0100, 2.0010 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 2 doesn't help us estimate the limit.
\item \( \{ 1.9000, 1.9900, 1.9990, 1.9999 \} \)

This is correct!
\item \( \{ 1.9000, 1.9900, 2.0100, 2.1000 \} \)

These values would estimate the limit at the point and not a one-sided limit.
\item \( \{ 2.0000, 1.9000, 1.9900, 1.9990 \} \)

If we get $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, the value 2 doesn't help us estimate the limit.

Evaluate the limit below, if possible.
\[ \lim_{x \rightarrow 6} \frac{\sqrt{8x - 23} - 5}{6x - 36} \]The solution is \( 0.133 \), which is option D.\begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]

You likely memorized how to solve the similar homework problem and used the same formula here.

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.

If you got a limit that does not match any of the above, please contact the coordinator.

You likely tried to use a shortcut to find the limit of a function that only works for when the numerator/denominator are polynomials.
\item \( \infty \)

You likely believed that since the denominator is equal to 0, the limit is infinity.

* This is the correct option as the limit is 0.083.

To estimate the one-sided limit of the function below as $x$ approaches 8 from the right, which of the following sets of numbers should you use?
